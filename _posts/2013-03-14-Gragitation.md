His friends having arrived for his graduation party, Montano stripped down
      and hopped into the bed located in the living room.    "Everyone
      in!"    Beem, Bunny, and M. Jourdan all hopped into bed with him, nude,
      and together they quietly watched that very funny television program about the mad
      scientiest...and the... shrinking...    (somewhere Bernie is laughing)
          Montano awoke abruptly to Beem deep in Bunny. Cries of ecstasy rang
      out as the fist went deeper.    "Ok. WOW. You two--out. Now" Banished to
      the torrential rain and the outer darkness. They leave in shame.    Montano leaned back into the bed. "Did you see that?" he asked Jourdan. "Sometimes I just
      don't know..."    Jourdan grabbed Montano's member in his hand and began
      to pump it. Montano grabbed his wrist.    "WHOA WHOA WHOA. Look, Jourdan.
      I like you. LIKE. That's it."    Their attention turned back to the mad
      scientist program.    Beem and Bunny had returned.    To Bunny: "Don't know if I can let you back in the bed. Still thinking."    To Beem: "But you...you...  you..."
