Montano slumped onto the plush red couch. It was late evening and he found
      himself seated alone on a long ramp in a parking garage.  "Is this residue from the
      drugs? How am I here?" he thought.  He recalled riding around in a gray jeep earlier
      that evening in a situation that was all too familiar.    "Dude, so we're
      going to pick up this girl that you haven't met but she's cool so don't worry about it," said
      the driver, Malvo, as he frantically prepared the drugs while glancing up at the road
      periodically.  Montano looked into the backseat to find the girl his friend had
      spoken of, her sleepy gaze returning his childish stare.  "Oh, hi," blurted Montano.
      Her mouth slowly formed into a weak smile. Montano again faced forward. This was just another
      anonymous girl who would not speak the rest of the evening save for plaintive murmurs.  A cloud of smoke filled the compartment as Malvo passed the drugs to the backseat.  The cloud grew thicker as the jeep progressed onwards into the darkening forest. Montano
      felt a gentle nudge on his shoulder, and he looked over to find the smoking pipe.  "Oh, uh, no thanks." He took the pipe and handed it back to Malvo, whose face was already
      beginning to freeze into the grin Montano knew so well.  The girl would whisper
      something periodically, to which Malvo would respond with ridiculous answers in assuring
      tones. Montano sighed.    He was back on the couch. Moptop approached and
      sat down next to him.  "It's a really important musical number from the 80's," he
      prematurely explained.  "What is?"  Immediately, music with a phat but
      steady beat emanated throughout the garage. Moptop smiled and began to sing along with the
      music, each syllable lining up with the beats. His hand bounced back and forth between his
      knees as he sang:  "Nine-teen eight-y-sev-en...more-ov-er-weight-wom-en!"
