"Popcorn, Montano."    Snapping into focus at the
      mention of his name, Montano frantically tried to figure out what was going on. Eyes began
      turning towards him with each passing second until finally help came from the desk behind
      him.    "We're doing popcorn reading. So just read for awhile and then say
      somebody's name when you're done and they'll read," explained Mandersala. Montano nodded in
      understanding and turned back to his desk. He didn't have the book they were using, and turned
      back once more to ask Nealsonic if he could use his copy. Since Montano had been gracious
      enough to switch seats with him earlier, he agreed and handed him the book.    "What page are we on?" asked Montano of the student next to him. She flipped the book
      open to the correct page. Montano sat there in silence as everyone waited for him to begin
      reading. After several long minutes of this silence, murmurs began emanating through the
      classroom from Montano's incompetence. Finally, he chimed in to explain:    "Um, where are we? I have no idea where we are in the story."    The
      same student indicated for him which paragraph to start at, much to Montano's relief. But
      surely he couldn't read until he had picked somebody to read after him! His eyes scanned the
      classroom, increasing the delay of his reading by an even longer stretch. Discontent was
      growing at his idiocy.    "Popcorn, Ruthep." Montano smiled and sat in
      silence, pleased with his choice. A minute later, another student finally broke in and
      explained that he hadn't read anything yet.    "Oh! Ha!" Montano again
      found the correct paragraph and began: "'So, w-whether...it be by werewolf...'" There was no
      masking Montano's difficulty in reading the passage, though part of the struggle came in
      having to read over the shifting silhouettes of the attractive monsters on the printed page: "
      'Or vamp-ire or m-mummy, she was...sure to meet her fate...at one of their h-hands.'"    Montano stopped. There wasn't anybody named Ruthep in the classroom.
      Immediately, another classmate pointed out this same fact. Cries of frustration erupted in the
      classroom, for now he would have to pick yet another person before finishing his reading. But
      Montano didn't know who to pick, for Ruthep had been such a good choice in his mind, the ideal
      candidate. He panicked and simply began reading again.    "'True, she
      had...loved h-him, but these c-comp-li-cations would only...put...more conflict i-in their
      relation...ship.'" Montano hated this vampire novel, yet continued on.    Several minutes later, and after agonizingly completing only a very small paragraph,
      Montano shut his book. Sighs of relief could be heard throughout the room.    "Wait!" he exclaimed. "Ruthep IS in this classroom!" With a brisk motion he turned around
      and pointed at the desk where Ruthep was seated. She returned a timid smile and a laugh before
      beginning to read where Montano had left off.    "Fools!" thought Montano.
      "How could they not know Ruthep was in here?!"
