&nbsp;  (It's the Josquin of Mario Karts!)      &nbsp;"The Scandinavian Heritage Group meeting has already started,"
      explained the woman in the shop. "Just go on up." She motioned to a secret door in the
      wall.    The meeting room was very dimly lit with high ceilings. Montano
      sat down at one of the tables and picked up a menu; gave it a quick once over:    CLACKER- Broiled cod with melted chocolate sauce  FRUIT TOPPER- a
      layered fruit dessert    Montano didn't feel hungry. "I'll have the
      clacker," said a man at the table next to him. Montano looked over at him but was distracted
      by a strange blue square stuck in the wall. Or was it in the wall?    Elsewhere: "I've got proof that half of the world is intending to annihilate the other
      half. They are setting up two large geodesic domes, but the air quality will only be suitable
      in one of them. They're planning to suffocate the other half!" cried the man. "And it's all on
      this video." He held it up triumphantly.    "Well then we need to hide
      that," said his wife. The man took the video and headed into the freezer. He peeked his head
      into the blue square in the wall and set down the tape. The freezer immediately grabbed it and
      processed it into several hamburgers.    "It's all over. The tape is
      destroyed," said the man as he wandered back into the kitchen. The sunlight was casting a
      strange glow on the hilly landscape outside. In a similar house not far away, Montano also
      observed the unusual lighting.    "Is it always this mysterious in Texas?"
      he asked the woman next to him. He wrapped his arms around her and hugged her tightly.
      "It's...its just all so beautiful," a tear falling from his eye.    But
      the best part about Texas are the roads! Sure the tax money doesn't really pay for them to get
      patched up and fixed, but that's what's so fun about them. It's kind of like Mario Kart. You
      have to jump over certain hurdles and occasionally drive through really rough terrain. Montano
      enjoyed it. Even the time when he fell into a deep moat with his car (he hit his head on a car
      already in it upon landing. Another car came splashing down behind him).    Muldoon opened the door into Scandinavian Heritage Group's meeting. A table of girls
      looked over at him and recognized that his eyes were not human. They were most distinctly
      reptilian.    "He's one of them!"    Muldoon smiled
      deviously. "Clever girl."
