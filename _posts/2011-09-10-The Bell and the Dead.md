One could hear the weight shift. A crack formed suddenly in the ceiling
      above the instruments, holding at first but then multiplying rapidly until the bell tower
      collapsed.    "Get them out, get all the instruments out. Especially this
      one," ordered the handicapped Montano in an old European voice that matched a specific
      renaissance viol. "Get them out."    The room was cleared and the problem
      of how to remedy the room came to the fore. Above the ceiling where the bell tower had been, a
      woman dug through the rubble to find a jar of green slime.    "What's
      this?" she asked Montano, who now with the use of his legs, joined her on the roof. The jar
      slipped from her hand and broke onto the ground.    "Hmm," said Montano as
      he poked it with a stick. He held it up, waiting for the slime to drip down. It would not and
      he knew then that he was dealing with The Color Out of Space.    A trip, a
      shuffle. "Damn!" cried Montano as he struggled to scrape the slime from his shoe. With each
      second the sticky substance found new surfaces to cling to including Montano's arm.    He stumbled down the hallway, growing weaker with each moment. He felt his
      teeth, their pointed growth, his diseased skin. He was changing. The woman shuffled down the
      hall behind him, also having been infected by The Color Out of Space. Montano went up to her,
      and placed his hands on her chest from behind. "I'm not saying we're monsters...but we're
      monsters." He knew then that all that would follow would be because of him, the first
      undead.    These events transpired in the year of the great peace, when
      mankind finally resolved to lay down its weapons and put an end to conflict and violence. But
      their action was to prove shortsighted. The destruction of all firearms was tragically
      mistimed. A small town now, its residents protesting the coming mob of undead to devour the
      town. What can they do? Reason with them from behind a police line? A man runs up the street
      to join them, sees the vile horde approaching and turns running. Runs though an empty
      neighborhood, attempts to enter a large dollhouse, and continues running running into a forest
      near a    lake at night. A solitary rowboat makes its way across the dark
      waters, illuminated by a single lamp. The undead rise from beneath the waters and swim towards
      it, attempting to climb aboard, to capsize it. There are too many of them, and the silently
      the two men aboard watch with detached resignation at what they know is the end.
