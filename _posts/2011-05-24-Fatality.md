On the extremely crowded staircase Montano felt himself falling backwards
      as somebody grabbed his hood. Two hands pressed strongly against his face.    "Gotcha!" cried the bully.    "Unhand me," said Montano, "or I will
      become more powerful than you could ever imagine."    After a time the
      bully did let him go, but as soon as Montano continued his ascent a hand grabbed his hood. He
      felt hands pressing again into his face.    "Fooled you!"    "Unhand me or I will become the most powerful force in the universe."    The bully did not comply, but when Montano noticed a slight decrease in
      pressure of the hands against his face, he grabbed both of the bully's arms, flung him over
      his head and slammed him on his back onto the stone floor. Montano leapt into the air, aimed,
      and forcefully came down on the bully with his knee slamming thunderously into his opponent's
      groin.
