"How do you get to ride in the helicopters?" asked Montano.    "You simply close your eyes and fall down," explained Mandersala.    Montano could not describe how much he wanted to be in the helicopters. There
      was nothing that could possibly be more thrilling to his mind.    One by
      one the people in the room shut their eyes and fell down to the floor rigidly like planks of
      wood. Montano looked down at Mandersala, her body sleeping yet her mind in a helicopter.
      Consumed with excitement, he shut his eyes and let his body fall backwards onto the
      carpet.    Moments later he opened his eyes to find the ceiling of the
      room above him. He was not in a helicopter. He got up, shut his eyes and fell again. As much
      as he didn't want to believe it, he was still not in a helicopter.    This
      wasn't fair! Why should everyone else get to ride in the helicopters?! What had he done to
      deserve this? He looked down at their still bodies-all of them psychically in helicopters.
      They were gone and he could not follow.
