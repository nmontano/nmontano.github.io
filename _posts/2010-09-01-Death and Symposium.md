The car pulled into the shoulder of the on-ramp behind two other vehicles.
      Montano, from his position in the backseat, peered out the window in an attempt to discover
      the source of the delay. Just ahead of a jeep was the newly dead carcass of a cow. Nothing
      more than bones and skin. "At least it was probably a quick death," thought Montano.    It wasn't. As soon as he reassured himself of this, he noticed the very
      slight twitching of the cow's back leg as it in vain tried to lift itself up from the ground.
      Montano's eyes widened in horror. "Where are the cops?!" he cried to the other passengers in
      the car. "This cow is still alive! There's no hope for it anymore! Somebody needs to shoot it!
      Put it out of its misery!!" He frantically looked back out the window as the cow again tried
      to lift itself only to collapse down to the ground. Montano's car lurched forward just as the
      jeep ahead of them did, and he realized that   they   were the police. Yet, as Montano rode past the dying cow, he
      realized that they had only come to harvest the poor creature's innards, which had already
      been cut into steaks and wrapped into a giant sausage coil. The cow lifted his head and cried
      out as Montano passed, their eyes meeting as his own filled with tears. The beautiful woman
      seated next to him remained emotionless, and though he didn't know it at the time, she was
      actually his barber.    Montano wept.    Much later,
      he found himself in a enormous luxury hotel, the purpose of his previous voyage having been to
      take him to the Symposium there. He was seated at a rather long table and was joined by
      various other academics.    "Oh, Montano, let's make pesto!" suggested
      Barit.    "Err, ok, I think I have a recipe for that. Or maybe it is for
      the French version,   pistou.  "    He got up from the table and began looking for S. Churchyard, who the
      previous night he had tried to catch in a mad dash through the hotel so as to return the money
      he borrowed. Moptop, too, had joined in the chase, but for his own, hidden purposes. To no
      avail; S. Churchyard was faster than him. He continued the search and walked down the long
      table. Jelnikia motioned for him to stop.    "Would you eat lavender?" she
      asked, pointing at the menu.    "Oh. Me? Haha, no. I don't think so. I
      mean some people do and that's fine, but it seems like there's something just a   little   bit weird about it. I don't eat it." He
      noticed that she had changed her stationary from saying 'The University of Virginia" to "The
      University of Maryland."    He continued on and came to two young women
      who were holding up pieces of papers that said "667" and "656". These were the numbers that
      indicated their menu selection. Montano stopped and looked at them, and then flashed the girls
      a charming smile before continuing on. Where was S. Churchyard?
