Montano was growing weary of the chase through the sculpture garden. It had
      been great fun at first, with the white rabbit eagerly scampering after him as he would run
      away and hide, but he was tired now. As he stopped to catch his breath under the purple
      evening sky, the rabbit caught up to him and began jumping around him, eager for him to run
      yet again. Montano had stopped near the edge of a large precipice, which gave him an
      idea.    Montano and the rabbit lined up facing the sharp drop of the
      cliff.    "O.K. Now it's a race to see who is the fastest," he explained
      to the rabbit. "Ready...GO!"    They both ran forward, but Montano only
      took a step before stopping. He watched as the rabbit tumbled far down the cliff, satisfied
      with his solution. As he turned to leave, the rabbit hopped back up the cliff in a single
      bound and began running after him again.
