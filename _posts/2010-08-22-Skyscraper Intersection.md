The young man flicked his cigarette into the ground and looked serenely out
      into the deep night sky. "We have to go now," ordered his girlfriend. "They could be here any
      moment." They were on the lam from nameless people to whom they owed money, and to be caught
      would spell doom. The young man hopped into the driver's seat and began sweeping off the large
      pile of dead grass that had accumulated there. They screeched onto the highway and deeper into
      the night.    Elsewhere, Montano was sprinting down a movie theater's
      large hallway, the Swedish girls cross country team trailing him by only a few feet. He was
      swift and agile, and impressively so based on the "ooohs" and "ahhhs" of the girls watching
      him from behind. "I don't suppose there has ever been anybody as good as me at this game," he
      thought. "I am the king of 'Raptor!'"    He looked up and noticed a
      life-size nutcracker approaching from the opposite end of the hall. This was just another part
      of the game, but he would have to play it carefully. The nutcracker increased in speed as it
      hovered towards him, and Montano kicked up the pace proportionally. As they came within feet
      of each other, by now at incredible speeds, Montano screamed and veered off sharply into a
      gold plated theater, missing the nutcracker by mere centimeters.    Montano seated himself. "YO!" yelled his grandpa from a box seat, but Montano did not
      reply. Soon, Rothdor and Natashya entered the theater and sat down next to him. As Montano
      turned to speak to Rothdor, the theater morphed and they were on a tall platform on the roof
      of a skyscraper. The sun peeked through the other buildings in the distance behind her.    "So, do you even go to the fair?" she asked him.    "No."    "Do you even like it?" Montano thought long and hard about
      this.    "Yes," he lied. She smiled at him, her teeth reminding him of
      corn.    Just below their platform, a large car swerved out onto the roof
      and drove off into a neighborhood where the houses had no doors.    "Why
      haven't they found us yet?" asked the girlfriend nervously. The young man remained silent and
      turned on the radio. He knew that reality was not what it seemed; the truth was too
      terrifying, and the girlfriend sensed that something was amiss. "Are they...even real?" she
      asked. The young man looked at her out of the corner of his eye, a tiny smile beginning in the
      corner of his mouth. Horror gripped his girlfriend, and tears began rolling down her face as
      she screamed the question again: "ARE THEY EVEN REAL?"    Over a steady
      80s synth beat, the radio sang: "  And yet for all his
      worth, Spanish Bob was dead...  "
