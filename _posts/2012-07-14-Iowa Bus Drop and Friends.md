Dmoon had a subscription to a magazine, but Bernie, ever devious,&nbsp;
      constructed a plan for preventing it from reaching its prescribed mailbox. He sent the same
      magazine to Dmoon on the day his copy would arrive, effectively bouncing it and returning both
      copies back to where they had originated.    ***    The tour bus crawled up the steep incline for what seemed like hours. Montano watched out
      the window, occasionally walking up and down the aisle to talk with various riders.    The bus reached the summit. It teetered there a moment before tipping over. A
      completely vertical drop for several miles. The bus plunged, passing motorcycles and other
      smaller cars on it's rapid journey.    Seconds before the bottom of the
      fall, the bus managed to come out upright and land perfectly horizontal to the prairie road as
      though there had never been a drop. It drove on, and Montano, completely thrilled and bursting
      with emotion from the trip, applauded enthusiastically.    ***    The play, musical, opera, etc was unknown. But the one constant was that
      Montano had to be seated several tiers above, alone for every performance.    ***    Montano turned to take the coffee Chiko had prepared from him.
      Chiko spoke, a coarsely graveled&nbsp; voice of a key in a lock. Montano turned back.
      Chiko had aged twenty years, and it was with of feeling of dread that Montano knew he was
      capable of a terrible seduction.    ***    "Stewe the
      town, Stu!"    ***    thought that the rain was/the
      sound of people going out to play bocce ball.
