Shame incomparable! "For unlawful impersonation, you are hereby banished to
      the high seas..." Santa's head hung low in the hall as he avoided the stares of those men and
      women he had come to love at the company. How could he look at them now, imposter that he
      was?!    He reached the office of the processing station. The young man at
      the keyboard there had already started filling in his information for the banishment. His eyes
      glanced back and forth uncertainly from computer to Santa. "Hmm. Ok. I don't know how to spell
      your name. Would you mind?" Santa sat down at the computer and typed in:    KAPLAN C. MONTGROGRAFIER    The man resumed his seat and Santa
      waited.   Maybe,   he thought,   I should have given my name as Santus
      Clausulus...
