title: Strange Trash

Clean, metallic, industrial. The walls segmented into numerous rectangles.
      Montano looked down on the shiny, immaculately clean floor beneath him impressed.    The cleaners arrived with brooms in hand. A loud whirring emanated from
      everywhere in the facility. The cleaning had begun.    The rectangles on
      the wall began to vibrate back and forth, emitting bursts of hot air that pushed the trash on
      the floor in one direction, only to be repositioned by air from another delivered precisely at
      the correct interval. From there the cleaners would push their brooms onto the trash, wittling
      away at it until it had disappeared.    Montano had trouble battling the
      wind blasting around him, but remained upright. A small puddle of trash, brown and metallic
      formed near his feet.    'This is always a tough one,' said a cleaner.
      'All that krampus!'    He was joined by other cleaners who together pushed
      their brooms into the trash. It was resistant and by the prolonged effort of the cleaners
      Montano could see why it required all of their efforts to remove it.    The trash, focusing in on a microscopic level, was made of many artifacts of the past
      day. Montano had no difficulty dissecting it into smaller and smaller pieces with his knife to
      aid in the cleaning process. But then he stopped as he noticed what was in the middle of the
      trash.    The Animal, now in the form of a cougar, sat there looking at
      Montano with trusting eyes. The same animal that Montano had saved from the flood house and
      who had been his companion. It had to be removed. Montano slowly inserted his knife vertically
      into the creature. Tears streamed from his eyes and onto the trash as he began to quarter the
      beast.    "Will someone else..."    Nobody would. He
      continued to dismember the cougar, who looked up at him with accepting, loving, and
      understanding eyes.
