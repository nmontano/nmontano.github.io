A sleepy hand reached out from under the covers and grabbed the ringing
      phone.    "Dr. Grant," it was the museum curator. "I must insist that you
      do not return to the island. If-if you do, then I fear that we'll all be in some sort
      of...  blood   night."    Grant hung up the phone and rose from the bed. As he threw on his bathrobe, he grabbed
      the device and headed over to the adjacent bedroom. Malcolm awoke as the door opened, and
      Grant walked over to set the device on the table. Malcolm flicked it on, and a gray panel slid
      back to reveal a tiny dinosaur fossil. He grinned at Grant.
