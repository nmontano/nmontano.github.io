Hazy mists.    A blindingly white shelf of sky rests
      over the land out of time.    A horse, briefly.    Two
      gurgling streams border a square plot of grassy land. Horse comes closer before turning around
      and playfully running through one of the streams. It stops in the square.    Quietly, in the distance, the moans and shrieks of an approaching garbage
      truck.
