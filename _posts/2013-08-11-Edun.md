Turned to his right to see the handsome man in the doorway, a black abyss
      behind him. Montano had been losing more and more clothes during each iteration of this event.
      For a second he panicked and looked for some shorts, but almost as quickly he overcame his
      shame.    "Come on in, it's nothing you haven't seen before anyway."    The handsome man proceeded to the dresser where some photos were taken out of
      his briefcase. Montano found himself incredibly aroused by his own indiscretion, even as he
      pulled on some boxers.    Montano left the room and entered into a hallway
      of leaves. One so very beautiful. The security guard there gave him a smile as he passed
      onward to certain pain.
