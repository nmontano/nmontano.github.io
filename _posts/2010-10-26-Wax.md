The husband and wife sat in the back seat as Montano drove them to their
      destination. They spoke in quiet voices but he could still make out some of what they were
      saying:    "Oh, honey, put those away."    "Why?
      They'd be good for me!"    "What?! No. Get rid of them. You don't need
      them."    "Well, I don't want to just throw them away!"    "I don't care   what   you do with them,
      just get rid of them."    "Hey, I bet   he   could use them."    A hand emerged from behind
      and offered Montano a Q-tip which he took and immediately shoved in his left ear. He scraped
      it around, but upon removal no wax had been collected. He took a towel and put it in his right
      ear, and then inserted the Q-tip within that.    He froze in horror when
      he realized that the husband and wife thought he had ear wax.
