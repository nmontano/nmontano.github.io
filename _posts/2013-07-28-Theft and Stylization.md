"Mr. Gelist?"    The aged man with white hair turned to
      Montano.    "Have you seen any black backpacks around?"    He nodded knowingly and beckoned Montano to follow.    Montano had
      wronged one of the students. Pushed him down the stairs. Peter Akinawa didn't deserve it.
      Montano was just frustrated. All of those girls were acting so inappropriately, biting him and
      all. Akinawa happened to be in the wrong place when Montano could no longer take it. And now,
      as Mr. Gelist lead Montano deep under the school into a space blindingly white and miles long,
      he saw some skateboarders in the distance.    Popping down off a pipe,
      Montano approached Akinawa.    "I'm sorry."    "Eff
      you."    Montano ran after him.    "I just want my
      backpack back."    "Don't give it back!" cried another skateboarder.    Montano, who had him by the leg, began to spin him slowly on the ground. "I'm
      not going to get you in trouble for taking it. I just want to be friends. And I want my
      backpack back."    The skateboarders were dubious at first but eventually
      Akinawa consented.    "This would have been great on Kolbare!"    Kolbare entered the room from another area and Montano slowly approached
      him.    "Look at this!" said Kolbare as he peered into a CEO's office, the
      city lights shining brightly in the dark night.    "And this lamp is
      great," noted Montano.    "Oh, it's fantastic! And this butter here!" A
      wedge of butter in a glass dish.    "And what's amazing is that it's real
      butter."    "Wow. I'm just--wow."     They looked at
      each other, and both. handling carefully the vomit-soaked pieces of paper in their hands,
      embraced in a hug of friendship.
