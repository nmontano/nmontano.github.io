On an open plain a bus is cruising beneath a cracked sky of orange, white,
      and black. Two meth cooks, Montano and Lavick, sit next to each other. The driver has informed
      them that they are on their way to a nursing home so that some lotion there may be used.    Montano can tell that Lavick is a bit stressed out so he takes a hand and
      places it on her exposed back. The skin is very soft, like it has just been moisturized,
      though he draws no connection between this and the driver's mission. He places his other hand
      on her back and begins massaging. Small gasps of delight escape from her mouth. He keeps at it
      and her cries of delight grow louder. As this progresses it becomes apparent that Lavick is
      having an orgasm and Montano stops.    They sit there for a while, first
      without talking, and then gradually into mundane chit chat. But between them there is an
      understanding that the bus driver needs this lotion for masturbatory purposes.
