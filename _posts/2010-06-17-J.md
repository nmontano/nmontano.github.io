The thick forest darkened as the storm approached. The wind had been
      escalating rapidly from gentle breezes to violent gusts that slowed Montano's progress as he
      made his way through the dense greenery. The wind roared through the branches of the trees,
      creating a sound that made Montano uncomfortable. Despite his unease with the setting, he
      struggled on towards the small, dilapidated shack just a little further ahead. He didn't know
      why he had to get there, but he felt compelled all the same. The storm was almost upon him
      now, and he picked up his pace the best he could to push against the adverse winds. Finally,
      he reached the shack and began feeling along the edges of it for an entry, succeeding just as
      the storm broke. Exhausted, he slammed the door shut and looked around as the wind howled
      through the cracks in the wall of the dark shack. What had brought him here?    His eyes looked down and came across something so marvelous, so wondrous that he was
      immediately filled with an ecstatic joy, yet one that was so strong that it could only be felt
      in muffled tones. He knelt down and gathered The One Who Left into his arms, their combined
      warmth and happiness at having found each other blocking out the sounds of the terrible storm
      that rained down around them.
