Looking from mountain to mountain, Montano asked: "So are these the
      Rockies? Or the Tetons? Or are they the D-dodongon..."    Montano and his
      family were on vacation and in need of a hotel room. Montano spied a greek temple from a
      distance with a neon Subway sign. "Hey this is a good hotel if I remember correctly."    The hotel lobby contained strange, warped and checkered floors colored a deep
      blue. Along the walls were hundreds of lockers. Risho was already there, but when The Man in
      Glasses tried to talk to him he just kept smiling at them and walked past.    The family got to their assigned locker and pulled it open. Hundreds of frozen fish
      rolled out on a tray, and Ghala immediately grabbed the fermented shark and bit in. When she
      had devoured the underbelly, Montano's mom flipped it over to eat the remaining flesh. The
      shark dangled precariously from its bones.
