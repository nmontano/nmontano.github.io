It was dark in this vision and Montano knew the worst was yet to come. It
      was all unfolding in three very distinct acts, each one more terrifying than the last.
      Finally, the climax: Montano could feel the ghosts pushing him around, pulling his arms and
      legs in a violent fury. "Have I seen this in a movie somewhere?" he thought. The pain became
      excruciating as the invisible fiends tried to rip his limbs from their sockets.    Montano awoke with a start, sweating profusely. Without thinking, he jumped
      out of bed and ran down the stairs and out the front door. The world had a yellow and green
      tint that made him slightly uncomfortable. He ran down the neighborhood streets, hearing an
      odd pounding as he progressed. Following the noise, he found it to be coming from a specific
      house. He peered into the window to find an overweight man sitting at a kitchen table with a
      calculator. After brief periods of computation, the fat man would pound the table, exclaiming
      "NO! NO! NO! NO!"
