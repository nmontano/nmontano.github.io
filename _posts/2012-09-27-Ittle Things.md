After Gove, a droopy eyed dog he had encountered before, was hatched from
      the beer can, Montano ran down a brightly lit sidewalk between movie rental stores. A racquet
      ball slipped out of his pocket and bounced down away from him and into the pond. It floated
      across to rest peacefully on the embankment on the other side and Montano was filled with
      happiness.
