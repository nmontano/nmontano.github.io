"Dear Moptop and Montano,    Thank you very much for
      sending me a copy of your new Donkey Kong novel. As a future nocturne librarian, I very much
      appreciate the thought of you giving me a copy. But now you must be asking yourself: where
      does this leave me in my writing career?     Best of luck,  
      Librarian"      Montano sprinted out of the mountain top nursing
      school donning an enormous fur hat. He ran across the snowy expanse as the figure of Moptop
      ran at him from a distance, slowly approaching with each passing minute. At long last they
      intersected, and Moptop handed off the Donkey Kong novel encased in a bible jacket, and
      Montano veered off sharply.    "THIS COULD BE A BOMB," he
      realized.
