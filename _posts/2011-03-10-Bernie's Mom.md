Parked in the garage Montano glanced at his rear view mirror to see a large
      semi turning into the driveway. Not just a truck- its strange metal face was   looking   at him. He hurried out of the car and into
      the house as it began to pull in.    The sun was streaming in through the
      large windows and onto the linoleum floors. A very large beagle greeted Montano as he made his
      way across the kitchen to Bernie's mom-a skinny rail of a woman with a diminishing cigarette
      in hand. She was on the phone and so he silently waved. She gave him a slight look, one of a
      barely acknowledged existence, and turned away. As he left to go pet the dog again, a voice
      came from behind:    "HEY! Did you do this? Take off your shoes. You just
      made a mess on my floor. Are your shoes dirty?" He looked over and indeed there were smudges
      on the floor, but he knew it was from dog drool. Nevertheless, he removed his shoes.    Who was she talking to? "Look. I just really want you in to see the doctor. I
      don't know if you have anything but I'm worried about that flabby male prostitute." Must be
      Bernie's sister "Say what you will but we can have the appointment now because of the health
      care bill...yeah I'm glad that shit passed."
