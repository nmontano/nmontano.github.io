Frustration was running high as Montano, his sisters and their mother sat
      around the large dining table in the wilderness.  "I can't believe that they just
      plowed the whole southern half of the neighborhood," remarked Ghala.  "It's an
      outrage!" exclaimed Montano.  "They're just demonstrating some of the worst behavior
      I've ever seen," began mother. "They're just being so niggardly! N*gger, n*gger,
      n*gger!"  Montano grew pale; a black man in a white suit was standing directly
      behind her as she said this. Fortunately, his unease was relieved when the black man simply
      rolled his eyes at this outburst and proceeded to take all of their dinner orders.    Now, Montano found himself seated across from Gridin at a wedding reception
      in a retro dining club.  "I'm giving up food entirely," she said with an air of
      superiority.    The quartet of Montano, his mother and his sisters entered
      a grocery store, happy to find a warmer space from the frozen wilderness they had been
      traversing. But this reprieve was only to bring frustration to Montano, for a sports channel
      had set up a speaker system and golf display in the middle of the store, and this meant only
      one thing-    "Who wants to stay for the golf speech?" asked mother.  "We do!" replied Gridin and Ghala in unison.    Montano
      snapped.    "FUCK! I DON'T!" He went up to his sisters and punched each of
      them forcefully on the arm, then walked defiantly to the cereal aisle where he grabbed a
      bottle of authentic maple syrup, and then proceeded out the store's front door. He would
      wander the icy wasteland alone.
