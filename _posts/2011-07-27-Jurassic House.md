There was power underneath that Montano could feel through the hardwood
      floors. The earth split open, causing the house to fall deep into the crevice at a furious
      speed. Montano had prepared himself by grabbing onto a light fixture, but the others in the
      house now found themselves flying upwards, pressed against the ceiling.    The house came to rest when the earthquake abruptly stopped. Montano shoved a dino nugget
      into his mouth.    "What was that? An earthquake?" cried a flustered
      resident. "We've got to get out of here and take a look around!"    "No,"
      said Montano. "We can't."    "Why?"    "Because we're
      being hunted."    The earth ripped open again, and an unprepared Montano
      flew upwards against the underside of a table as the house dropped into the earth.    "SHOOT HER!" screamed Montano. "SHOOOOT HERRRRRR!!!!!!!!"    The earthquake halted and Montano dropped. Unfazed he immediately began searching for
      more dinosaur meat. A cardboard box on the floor caught his eye, and he approached it to
      find&nbsp; several dinosaur eggs. Hungry, he reached for one just as    thunder rumbled in the distance. In the cave, the dinosaurs stood around the iguanodon as
      it trembled under great stress. Finally, it sighed in defeat. The dinosaurs looked around at
      each other knowingly. A failure to produce eggs meant that his existence was no longer
      justified. The iguanodon looked at his wife in the audience.    "I can
      make eggs. I can make more...really..."
