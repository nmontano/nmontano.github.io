"The oldest grandmothers will be the first for the grease jet."    ***    Altenbach looked disdainfully at Montano shoveling
      spaghetti into his mouth in a corner of the room. Didn't he know they had to go fight the
      she-giant?    ***    "There is no shortage of fine
      candies, though one should be cautious as they are produced out of Auschwitz."    ***    Flanders, now a pig, transformed into a razor log
      and plowed through the house, collecting several legs and a butt from unfortunate victims in
      his path. He zoomed off into the horizon, leaving his son, a frog in a baseball cap, to stare
      blankly at the camera.
