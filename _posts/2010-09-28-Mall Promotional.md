When he tried to leave the mall, Montano discovered that the exits had been
      blocked by some employees, and he joined the group of increasingly restless people waiting to
      leave.    "Alright alright! We've got some great gifts for you guys
      today!" explained one employee. With that, they grabbed some black bags and began dumping out
      plastic coins into the hands of the disappointed customers. This was a stupid
      promotional.    Montano was lucky, and instead of coins, a dvd fell into
      his hands. The other customers stared at him and his prize as he considered what to do
      next.    As he held the dvd in his hands, he decided to unwrap the skin
      from the foot. When he began to peel back the layers, a shiny metal rod began to emerge from a
      flesh ball elsewhere in the mall but only in his head. He continued his task and very small
      naked women began to cling and climb the flesh ball until finally he became so repulsed by the
      dvd that he tossed the foot in the garbage and left the mall.    He got
      into his car and drove very far away through a dreary winter street and then immediately drove
      back, all the while crying about resurrections and conducting technique.
