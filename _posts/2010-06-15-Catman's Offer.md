The sun was streaming in through the large latticed window at the far end
      of the library where the gluttonous Catman lay reclining on a large pillow, basking in the
      morning light. A smug look of self-contentment etched permanently on his face, he lazily moved
      his eyes upwards from the untitled book he was thumbing through to observe the approaching
      figure of Montano.    "Ah, Mr. Montano. I am so pleased you could make
      it," he said in a slightly aristocratic tone that betrayed his intellectualism.  "Yes, it has been some time since our last meeting," remarked Montano. He couldn't
      remember when they had last spoken, but it had to have been years.  "As you know, I
      am a very influential man. I have the power to give much, and the power to take away much."
      This was true; Montano owed him his very namesake. "I am prepared to make you a special offer
      this day."    Montano gulped. It was unusual that he had been summoned at
      all to meet with the Catman, and he could not conceive what it was that awaited him. Catman
      cleared his throat, and with an unhurried demeanor began:    "I want
      you...to take the starring role... in MACBETH."
