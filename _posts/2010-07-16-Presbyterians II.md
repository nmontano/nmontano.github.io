The trio made their way down the central staircase of the round sanctuary.
      Montano spied a small desk that was gated off in the corner of the organ loft, and turned to
      The Man In Glasses:    "What is that for?"    "Oh, it
      is there in case there is a guest clerk of sessions."    "Ah."    They continued their descent, eventually reaching a door that lead outside to
      a series of small gray town homes. The Stern Man stood guard in front of one of the doors, and
      after greeting him, they all entered together into the dark chambers.    "I have a gift for you," said Montano.    "What is it?" asked The
      Stern Man    "A purple French novel!" Montano excitedly handed him the
      book, which The Stern Man took without a word.    As he glanced through
      its pages, discontent grew inside Montano. That was the fourth book in the series; it wouldn't
      make any sense if he started with that one. But deep down, the real reason was that Montano
      had already read the first three books, and wanted that purple book for himself. It was a very
      thick book, which only increased his desire.    "Give me that book back,"
      he demanded. "I messed up. You're supposed to start with the pink French novel. That's the
      first one in the series. I'll get it for you later. Besides, the first one isn't as
      thick."    The Stern Man stared at Montano before finally placing the
      purple book back in his hands after a few tense moments.    Montano became
      angry as he flipped through its pages. This book wasn't thick at all.
