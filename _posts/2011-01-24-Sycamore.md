Montano held the geographic coordinates before him. Later, he was to have
      difficulty explaining who it was who had sent him on this mad hunt. The Log Lady? Yes. Zecka?
      Yes. Two people? No. The music of a dark mood surrounded him as he penetrated deeper into the
      forest.    He began to dig in the fading light, having succeeded in
      following the coordinates to the designated site. Aha! So Zecka hadn't been false! Indeed,
      here lay the box he sought. He pried it open and pulled out a very large pair of blue contacts
      that filled him with a sort of uncomfortable knowing. He set them aside and pulled out the
      only other content: a piece of paper with a picture of a crude stick figure drawn on it. He
      had helmets for feet, and from his side protruded a crude phallus.    No,
      thought Montano. "And there was a knife coming from his side," he explained to the teacher in
      the wooden room. Yes. That was better.
