The actors and stagehands exited in droves out the glossy purple chamber
      above the theater. Against their current a black man in glasses protested:    "Hey! Hey don't go, guys! There is still time left! I can finish it! I can finish the
      play!" Nobody paid him any attention. "You can't leave me!"    "Sorry,"
      said a producer. "You're done."    Alone now in the chamber, dark thoughts
      began growing in the black man's mind:    "Y-You'll all pay!" he mumbled.
      Suddenly, his rage could not be contained: "YOU'LL RUE THE DAY YOU WRONGED SCOOP!"
