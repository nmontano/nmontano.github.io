Bernie, Brunk and Montano stopped next to a large armchair. The trip to
      reach Dalger's bachelor party was long and arduous, and a break was needed.    A phone rang. "Alo?" said Bernie. Montano could overhear loud commotion on the other end
      of the line. "It's Dalger," explained Bernie. "Wants to know if he can borrow my
      swimsuit."    "To put on his head?" asked Brunk.    "Probably," replied Montano, who was now seated sideways in the armchair in his own
      swimsuit. In his mind he saw the bachelor party, and Dalger being carried by many beautiful
      women. Naturally, he needed a swimsuit to put on his head.    Bernie
      continued on the phone for some time, wandering away from the others as he talked before
      finally hanging up. Then, though he couldn't see him, Montano knew that Bernie was standing
      directly behind him, naked, and silently expelling flatulence without shame.
