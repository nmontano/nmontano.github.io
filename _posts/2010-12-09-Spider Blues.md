With difficulty did Montano reshelve the small but extremely heavy books on
      quinoa. Having briefly looked at them both (unhulled and hulled volumes), he decided they were
      not for him and instead checked out a speaker system.    In a mall
      courtyard, Hammerthorn was helping the jazz band set up for their concert and Montano went to
      check on their progress.    "And this," he said holding up one of his
      speakers, "would be my boo box."    "You used to boom box?!" asked
      Hammerthorn excitedly.    "No. Boo box."    He set it
      down and a large red and white spider crawled out of it. Terrified, Montano stepped away from
      it quickly and began to run. "This would be my Jurassic Park scene," he explained. "KILL
      IT!"    "Nah, it's just a harmless cereal spider," observed a
      musician.    "No," said Montano. "It wants you dead."    The spider came across the jelly filling of a doughnut and stuck some of its legs in it
      to absorb the sugary substance. In ecstasy, the spider's movements slowed as it sucked on the
      sweet nectar.
