The soft red light of the bathroom enveloped Montano as he approached the
      toilet. Urinating, he quickly became aware of another person in the room with him--a large old
      man in the bathtub.    "Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry, dude!" exclaimed
      Montano. The man pulled at the curtain of the bathtub desperately and without looking at
      him.    There was a jagged black sink in which water was rapidly draining
      into a vortex. It was large, and Montano entered it, reaching for the faucet.    He and the others sat around the bathtub, the old man still resting within
      it. He listened intently to the conversation flowing among the group, and finally burst in
      when it seemed appropriate:    "Listen! Maybe we're not real! I could be
      hallucinating him-" he pointed at Moptop next to him- "and he could be hallucinating him-" he
      continued around the circle-"and he could be hallucinating her, and she him, and him-" he
      pointed at the last man, a guy in orange and blue glasses-"him, and him me!"    "Well," began the old man in the tub, "if I'm hallucinating this guy-" he pointed at the
      man in the trendy glasses, "then I'm going to stop and have a beer!"
