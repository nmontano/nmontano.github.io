The crude robot balanced tenuously on the bone above the red soil. "Why
      even make dinosaurs on Mars?" asked Bernie "They'll just fail like they did the last
      time."    The dinosaurs escape! Flash! Zoom! Through the deeps of space
      they fly! But alack! Their flight is not without travail, for they are being trailed by a
      couple of ice asteroids. They close in on the reptiles now and all appears to be lost. They
      will return them to martian lands. The dinosaurs will never leave again!    "Wuh? Uh-oh!" says an asteroid as he sees the dinosaurs' intended destination. He quickly
      turns around, followed by the others. The dinosaurs are free! And they crash land into the
      translucent planet, causing it to spin round and round. How silly!    What's this? The misfit asteroid, arriving much later than the others, slams into the
      planet with a goofy grin on his face. Within seconds, the entire sphere is turned icy cold
      (the dinosaurs shiver), then very hot (dinosaurs in sunglasses at the pool) and finally,
      somewhere in between. Everyone smiles with arms wrapped around each others shoulders, the
      misfit asteroid at the center of it all.
