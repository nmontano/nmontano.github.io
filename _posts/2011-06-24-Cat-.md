Night. Montano entered the street to begin his barefoot walk to the second
      orchestra concert of the day. Realizing he would have to walk about fifty miles there and back
      (again), he decided against it and went back into the garage of his house.    His mom was standing in the doorway connecting the house and the garage. "She's going to
      be so excited to see you!" she told Montano, referring to the kitten he would have to visit.
      The kitten was then in her arms and as Montano entered the house, quickly jumped at his arm.
      Her claws were tiny but still slightly painful as she played with him. She dashed about the
      room before leaping into the dark garage. "Hey! Get back here!" ordered Montano. The kitten
      jumped out of the darkness and onto his arm. Montano began scratching her head and she turned
      into a small plump man with white hair.    "OOO!! That feels good! Now
      scratch my back!" In the brief second when Montano's hand realigned itself, the man returned
      to being a cat, only to transform once again when his hand began scratching her back. "OOO!!
      That feels good! Now scratch my stomach!" Man. Cat. Man. "OOO! That feels good! Now scratch my
      tummy!" The man indicated to scratch further down into his pants. Montano removed his
      hand.
