      screamed.    "Give me the candy."    Montano looked
      away from the horses in the distance. Zaphen leered at him before grabbing his Oh Henry! candy

      eyes said too much. Prisoners of an insane institution.    Montano looked
      at the horses. Their acrobatics were beautiful and terrifying against the lightning.    A thin blade across the neck. A spilling.
