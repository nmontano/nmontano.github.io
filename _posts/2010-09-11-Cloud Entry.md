The wall of colorful stones collapsed on the boy for the second time as he
      rode the apocalyptic snake through the city. When he finally came to he found himself on a
      large cloud. There was a door on the other end and he tried it to find that it was locked. He
      buzzed the intercom system:    "Come on through," said a voice.    "Uh, I can't. It's locked."    "...want us to send the
      worms?"    "What?"    "We'll release some
      congressional platelets. They get attracted to a magnet near the door latch and activate it.
      You'll be able to open the door but they'll die in the process. Should we send 'em?"    "Yeah, ok, send the worms."
