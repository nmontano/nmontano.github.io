  There he is, being singled out from
      the audience. How exciting this must be! His big break, though he'll have to put on a real
      good show if he is going to impress them. He? She. Cleo Bernstein. Here she is on the podium.
      In the hall of the mountain-Yes! This is the piece I conducted on the back wall. No
      orchestra.                      Montano returned to his
      senses and looked into the fluorescent ceiling light only inches from his face. How long had
      it been since he had been traveling with Colonel Tigh to Colorado? And when had his
      imprisonment here started? He was certain he would never leave the grocery store. Chief walked
      past.    "Hey Chief! What's your favorite kind of apple?" asked Montano
      from halfway inside the room where he lay strapped on top of a large metal rack just below
      those horrific lights. Chief rebuked him thoroughly for talking. As he was about to leave,
      Montano started again.: "But Chief! You never answered my question!" "Gaia and Red Delicious,"
      he answered. "Haha! YEAH!" cried Montano as he high-fived him. He held no resentment towards
      his captor.    Sometime later, Montano was released from his torture and
      returned to the back wall in the store where he had conducted the piece by Greeg.    "I'm never getting out of here," he said to the crew members around
      him.    "What? What did you say?" asked Tory.    "You've trapped me here. Forever."    "No. You can leave anytime. Do
      you want to go now? Go ahead, though it might not be the safest idea."    Starbuck escorted him out, clearing the rooms ahead of him with her gun at the ready.
      "Alright," she said as Montano pulled up next to her with his bike. "Looks like the coast is
      clear except for the last exit. You're on your own now." Montano slowly pushed the bike out
      into the refreshing light of day.    "AHA!" cried a man in a blazer as he
      grabbed Montano's bike. They both vigorously pulled at it as Montano's mind raced. A trap
      indeed! But this man looked familiar.    "You're a music teacher," said
      Montano. The man relinquished the bike in utter amazement.    "Yes."                                "And
      is your name Ed Blessing?"    "...y-yes..."
