The image of glistening golden bodies etched permanently in his mind,
      Montano dashed out of the haunted sex house where he had left Kane and Krood to their own
      devices. Following in the wake of Merrem, this was to be his only successful escape from there
      that night, for he would return many times in increasing abasement.    He
      looked up into the night sky to discover a purple moon in sunglasses grinning down at
      him.
