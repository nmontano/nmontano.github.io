Night. Albert made his mad dash through the busy intersection. He had no
      time to spare, for at any moment his mother would realize what had happened and come charging
      after him. Sure enough, her cry of "Yoo-hoo! SONNY!" signaled she was on her way, and much
      sooner than he had imagined. He picked up the pace, leaping across the sidewalk in huge
      bounds. To no avail. Albert shuddered as a hand grabbed his shoulder from behind and flung him
      around. "Uh, hi momma..." he whimpered.    Shifter morphed into a young
      woman and Albert became Montano.    "I'm so glad we're finally getting
      married. I can live real cheap! I'll live in dirty apartments, anywhere. Its going to be great
      because we love each other." She hugged him. Montano hesitantly returned the embrace but was
      filled with an incomparable sense of dread. It was not even yesterday that he had claimed to
      never marry, and here he was, a victim. How could this have happened?    Morning. Before entering the townhome, Montano placed a water bottle on the door mat. As
      they opened the door, a large German Shepherd dashed out into the foyer to greet them. "Hey
      Whinoble!" exclaimed Montano, and the dog gave a bark in return. "Oh c'mere you!" He sat down
      on a couch and began massaging Whinoble's ears to the dog's whimpers of ecstasy.   This isn't so bad  , thought Montano.   I could be married.   Shifter had morphed into
      another young woman and returned to the room when the doorbell rang. Whinoble ran to the door
      as Shifter went to answer it. A young boy stood there. "Hey I found this water bottle and
      thought-" Whinoble exploded in a flurry of violent barks, scaring the boy off. "WHINOBLE!
      DOWN! NO! BAD!" exclaimed Montano. The dog gave him a malevolent, hypnotic stare.    Evening. On a large street people were milling about and conversing casually.
      Shifter had morphed into Chatterly/Riattz and wore a Miskatonic apron that said "At least I'm
      engaged!" Montano hated those aprons with every fiber in his body. Many females were wearing
      them, a popular variation being: "At least I'm sitting next to Erin!"    Chatterly/Riattz approached a microphone. "I'd like to tell everyone here today that
      Montano and I are now engaged!!" The crowd began clapping and faces turned towards Montano
      with grins that he loathed. He forced a weak smile in return.    He headed
      to the tiered embankment where much of the crowd was seated and watching the events on the
      street unfold. He took a seat in the back row. Shifter had become Krood and was seated next to
      Beem a couple of rows ahead of him.    "Hey Montano, do you still steal
      cds and sell them?" asked Beem.    "What? No! I mean I used to but I don't
      anymore! I'm a new man! You couldn't even get much money for them anyway!"    Krood and Beem laughed, but Montano was depressed. Could he ever love Krood? No, for here
      she was even now mocking him with another man! He turned to watch the street to find that it
      had turned into a luxury hotel room where he had stayed earlier with the political analyst. As
      he watched the room and began turning off some of the light fixtures with his mind, he
      realized that his foot was slightly nudging the black haired girl in front of him.    "Oh, I'm sorry-I keep bumping you!" he whispered.    "Don't worry about it!" she replied.    Montano loved her.
