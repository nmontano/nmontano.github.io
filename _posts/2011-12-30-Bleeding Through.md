The swimmers tore through the waves and towards the golden light -
      metaphorically speaking of course. One swimmer turned back around towards the shore, and
      having reached it, began swimming back out began walking in the sand back out to that great
      place in the ocean. To the place of animal dreams.    Only a few swimmers
      made it to the golden light to the book. A young man in dreds was among those fortunate to
      reach the purple waters surrounding it. He smiled as he looked around. Another male swimmer
      came from below and they smiled at each other and shared a kiss of mutual joy. But as the man
      in dreds pulled away, the other swimmer went up for another kiss, and they passionately
      embraced. ("This is certainly not allowed in DWD.")    All around was an
      intense joy that would never be diminished and never surpassed.    The
      purple book.
