The chess pieces lay strewn about on the board, not one remaining on its
      original square. Montano entered the room and became mildly incensed to see the destroyed game
      that now would never reach completion. The chess board had fallen victim to a torrent of
      composer busts that had resided on top of the adjacent dresser. But what had caused them to
      fall? As Montano investigated the scene, the static eyes of the great musicians watched
      silently.    Montano's search naturally brought him to the top of the
      dresser where he noticed a broken wine glass. This, he felt in his heart, was the reason for
      the tragedy. It was unclear how it had broke, but it was obvious that it had caused the storm
      of composer busts to rain down on the chess pieces far below.    Yet
      Montano could not bring himself to anger. The cup had separated from the long neck of the
      glass and now lay defeated next to it, small shards of glass scattered around it like
      misshapen diamonds. As Montano peered in to examine the tip of the broken neck, he felt his
      eyes fill with tears at the sight of such a tragic fate. He couldn't blame the glass for what
      had happened anymore than he could blame the busts or the chess pieces. They were all
      complicit in the act; both perfectly innocent and guilty, and just by evaluating the scene,
      Montano knew he had joined them in their ambiguous fate-one that lay somewhere between the
      white and black of the board before him.
