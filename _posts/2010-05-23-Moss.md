Montano walked closer to the white house set against a poorly painted
      backdrop of hills. The sun seemed to have been replaced by a fluorescent bulb. As he
      approached, younger women in purple dresses would periodically appear and walk past him
      without saying a word. "Must be a wedding nearby," he thought.  Montano entered the
      house. The main room was very dark and damp with moss covering the majority of the stone
      walls. Ahead of him at a large banquet table sat his grandmother who was laughing quietly to
      herself. One of his cousins, Merrem, was seated next to her but remained silent throughout the
      course of his visit. A few candles situated on the table flickered in the dark room.  As he approached the table he noticed that strewn across it were the remains of several
      cakes that looked as though they had been viciously devoured. Looking at his grandmother's
      face he observed that much of it was covered in powdered sugar.  "You'll have to
      excuse me," giggled grandmother. "I'm a bit cake-y."  "Oh, I see," replied Montano.
      "How much did you eat?"  She held up two fingers, mouthing the words: "Two
      pieces."
