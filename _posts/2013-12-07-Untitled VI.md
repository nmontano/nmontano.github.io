Very large van full of cleaning materials. Montano turns to see a golden
      retriever approaching, whimpering. The dog once had five legs. One is missing, and one is
      shrunken and about to fall off. There are cuts all over the dog face. It is wretched.    Montano puts out his hand for the dog to smell, but it whimpers and moves
      away.    "Poor Arthur," says the dog, referring to himself.    Montano bursts into tears for approximately one second/infinity before a
      woman in the back of the van, approaches him.   (The dog's owner?   thinks
      Erasmus)    "So you saw him," she begins, grabbing Montano's shoulders,
      "he was tall, muscular, what else?"    "Arthur?"    "We're talking about Eminem."
