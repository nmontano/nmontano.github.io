The shark family sat down to dinner.    "Alright! Since
      it's dad's birthday, I think we should propose a toast!" exclaimed the mother.    "But to what?" asked a daughter.    "To anything! Toast
      to whatever you want!" explained dad.    And so it began. Each family
      member began to name off their object of toast. But Charlie, far at the end of the table,
      could nary think of anything! No time left--they stared at him expectantly.    "To...to love!" he said with a betrayed uncertainty.    "To love?"
      repeated dad. "TO LOVE?! WHAT!!!"    Charlie sunk into his chair and
      awaited the wrath of his dad. An elephant floated in and whispered something to the mother
      with a coy smile on his face. Suddenly, the mother turned to the family: "I think I'm
      pregnant." It was apparent that the elephant was her lover, but when she said this, he seemed
      as surprised as the rest of them. She floated off and the musical number began. To lyrics more
      spoken than sung, she would pop out of large pregnancy tests in time to the music. Would the
      tests add up? Was she pregnant?    The sun was setting as Charlie, more a
      boy now, and 2-D, walked to the bridge with his fishing pole. He cast it into the river and at
      the sound, the head of his fish friend poked above the water. He stared out into the sun, the
      thin boundaries of reality trembling all around him. Heavy with sadness, Charlie stored his
      pole under the bridge and walked out into the growing darkness.
