Only one thing was certain: there was a gorilla in the house. Young Montano
      was unsure why it was there, or where exactly it had gone to after his brief sighting of it,
      but after a long period of searching he and his sisters had not been able to locate it.
      Somebody had decided that outside help was needed, and a detective was on his way. Young
      Montano and his sisters waited patiently.    The detective arrived and the
      search began. First was Young Montano's room. Every inch was searched-the closet, under the
      bed, everywhere-but the gorilla was nowhere to be found. The detective lead them on to the
      sisters' adjacent bedroom. Again, no luck was had. Only one place remained: the parents'
      bedroom.    As they entered the chamber, which was considerably bigger
      than the other two bedrooms, a strange heaviness fell over the air. "Could the gorilla be
      here?" thought Young Montano. No sooner had he thought it did one of his sisters, Ghala, let
      loose a loud simian cry. More shocking than this though, was the unexpected sight of the black
      hairy arms of the gorilla arising from behind the parents' bed, (which, curiously, was pushed
      up against the wall), and the subsequent roar it made in response to his sister's outburst.
      Despite this unbridled display of beastly passions, there was nothing to fear. The mystery of
      the absent gorilla was at an end.
