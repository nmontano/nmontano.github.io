The white horse was melting in the hallway outside the room Montano
      entered.    The end was happening and the air was dismal, heavy. The walls
      of the house were but a shadow of what they had been, now stained and cracked. The rest of the
      house was in a similar state of disarray, but what had happened was not entirely clear. The
      storm had come and passed, and now the world was crumbling in its wake.    Montano looked furiously throughout the room for his friend. So many had already
      crystallized and then melted it was difficult to say if he had even made it this far. Aha!
      Montano dashed over to a filthy mattress where a rapidly melting head blinked at him.    "What is it? What do you want me to do? There isn't much time." Montano held
      the head in his arms and helped the mouth move as it spoke silent words. An ear melted off.
      When the head was done, Montano nodded in understanding. The head shut its eyes.    "I'll...I'll tell them. I'll them all. That Minnesota, Wisconsin and
      Illinois...they all melted too..."
