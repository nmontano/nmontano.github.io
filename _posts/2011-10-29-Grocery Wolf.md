Montano slammed the wolf to the ground and pressed his arm onto it's neck,
      pinning it. This was the second time this had happened that day. It struggled mightily to
      release itself, making many attempts to bite at his arm without success. Montano signaled to
      somebody to call for the police. Nobody in the grocery store seemed to notice the wolf.    Quite a while later, the police had still not arrived and Montano was in pain
      from the effort of restraining the struggling wolf. Finally the faint sound of a siren drew
      near and Montano ran to the front door to greet officer Bensmer.    "Well
      we've got another wo-" Montano paused as he noticed the wolf now waiting politely in the check
      out line to purchase some mint jelly.    Montano led Bensmer over to where
      the wolf had been pinned. Jack, Moptop, Izabet and others were there intently looking through
      a fat stack of&nbsp; comic books.    Moptop came over and put a WWII
      comic book involving submarines into Montano's hand. The first panel showed a Nazi sub with a
      crack in its hull. There followed several panel of just blue water. A voice called from beyond
      and it became obvious that the submarine would sink because the Nazis had tried to teleport a
      whale.
