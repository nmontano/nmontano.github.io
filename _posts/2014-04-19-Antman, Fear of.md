Vague images of the trial.    Antman, the
      murderer.    Montano testified against him. Repercussions
      inevitable.    Early morning. Strange bird sounds. Montano's eyes, still
      blurry, open and wander over to the screen on the window. A black shifting mass, hypnotic,
      crawling towards the small hole in the screen. Antman's revenge.    Montano falls back asleep AND REAWAKENS. He goes to the window.    Not ants and all. Asian lady beetles, and a few other misfits. All dead or dying on the
      windowsill, having feasted on the cold coffee and brown sugar he left there.    He laughed and laughed and laughed.
