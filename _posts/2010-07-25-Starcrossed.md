The young men moved about the industrial cave, welcoming the break from
      their journey. Montano approached a particular one who was sitting shirtless and distanced
      from the others and sat down next to him. The blond male, Brick, placed his hand on Montano's
      knee with a gentle caress that he knew all too well.    "Will you be able
      to go with me?" asked Montano with trepidation.    "I was sent to help you
      on your journey," Brick began, a smile on his face. "But my function has been fulfilled and I
      can go no further."    Deeply saddened, Montano knew this to be true and
      had long seen it coming. He had known what Brick was all along, but this couldn't stop the
      wellspring of emotions he felt for him. Words could be of no more use here, and Montano and
      Brick embraced for the last time.    Montano glanced down at the other men
      as he began to leave the industrial cave. How desperately he had wanted to believe that
      Brick's love for him was genuine, though deep down he had always known it wasn't. He needed to
      push Brick out of his mind, for indeed, none of his emotions were real. All of those tender
      moments were meaningless. Brick was only a computer program.
