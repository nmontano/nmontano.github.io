Moptop had written a new Call of Cthulhu mission and Montano was very
      excited. But just as they began to play, he and his character were sent to a bathroom where
      they were confronted by a large glowing head. The head lifted him and his character up and
      threw them into a shower where they were pulverized by excruciatingly painful electric
      rays.&nbsp; He realized he was being killed off. "Sorry," said Moptop as he entered the
      room. "This mission just really didn't fit your character."
