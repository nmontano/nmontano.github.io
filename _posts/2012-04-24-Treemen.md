The late autumn light cast the forest into a tangle of shadows. A chill
      wind blew through the branches.     Montano stepped onto the deck and
      looked out onto the city of treemen. He raised his arms and the treemen followed suit. He
      raised both and they copied. They looked at him with a cold obeisance.     A rogue treeman crunched the forest and towards the deck. Montano spotted him and raised
      his arms. The treeman followed. Montano then made a masturbatory gesture with his hands. The
      treeman followed.     The treeman continued his march towards an
      increasingly fearful Montano. It was on the deck now, and Montano quickly retreated into his
      house. Almost immediately the treeman was at the door and attempting to enter. Montano
      struggled with the lock. From outside the window the treeman looked stonily at Montano. "Can
      anyone help with the lock?" He fumbled with it more as the treeman continued his attempt to
      enter. "Hello? Help?"
