Darth Vader slowly approached the thinner copy of himself.    "Join me," it said to him. "Come to the dark side."    They stood face to face, and the copy spoke again.    "But first, I
      must see something."    He took his hand and gently felt along the back of
      the real Vader, relishing the defined musculature and firm tone of his body.    "You-you're a woman," said the copy to Samus Aran, surprised and betraying more than a
      hint of arousal.    "As are you," replied Samus. Indeed, the copy had
      morphed as well, and there was an undeniable attraction flowing between them.    On Earth, the audience stood up and began singing the theme song for the
      school musical while marching in place.    "When you're a cop!  You get to drive in a car!..."    The opener ended and the next
      number began. A boy and a girl on separate asteroids floated into the auditorium mechanically.
      The boy started the pop song:    "My little asteroid friend,  Where ever did you land,  I've looked all around for you!"    The girl began her part but immediately forget the lyrics, and the audience watched
      uncomfortably as her face froze, the sparse accompaniment continuing in the background.
      Slowly, she and her asteroid fell into the pool of water in the middle of the stage and sank
      quietly to the bottom.
