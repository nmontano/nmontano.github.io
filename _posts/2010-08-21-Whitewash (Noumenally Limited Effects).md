The lights reflected on the marble floor of the bathroom below Montano's
      naked body. As he reached into the closet to grab a towel, a small voice in his head began to
      speak:    "You know, it has been a while since...well...  you know...  "    Montano did
      know. But was it necessary? He thought back to his meeting with the Indian girl as they sat on
      his bed:    "But I don't want it to inhabit me!" she stated.    "  Inhibit  , you
      mean."    Montano wanted some of that hot Indian action. He set the towel
      back in the closet and at once got to work. He needed to practice; it had been far too long.
      But no sooner had he started did the years of disuse catch up with him, and he quickly erupted
      in a shower of white rain. Gallons of the translucent emulsion splattered everywhere, coating
      the entire bathroom in a sticky web.    "Fuck!" he said, the white globs
      dripping off the ceiling onto his shoulders. He began throwing towels on the floor to absorb
      it, but this was going to take a long time.    The door suddenly burst
      open, and the entire world looked in at the room in horror, then revulsion, finally anger, and
      insisted that he clean it all up immediately. Embarrassed beyond measure, he grabbed a paper
      towel and kneeling, still naked, began soaking up his mess as the world watched in
      disapproval.
