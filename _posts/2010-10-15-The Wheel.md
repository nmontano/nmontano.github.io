"AND WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE DOGS!"    The radio host
      slammed the door in the face of the fan, who was indeed holding a puppy as a gift and sign of
      his adoration. The host turned to his wife:    "Be sure to send a card in
      thanks for the dog."    This sequence of events had happened innumerable
      times already. The dog celebration, people bringing dogs, the rain storm, etc. It would happen
      again.    On cue from the door slamming, the ceremony began in front of
      the sink- Montano now the focus. Facing him sat The Man in Glasses and Mikma.    "First," started The Man in Glasses, "I'd like to say how much I appreciate
      Montano's sense of honor to everyone. And how he selflessly gives himself and tries to help
      everyone. And how he never gets jealous of anyone," Mikmar nodded silently to all of these
      things, "And that he likes to give to charity, and save people from disaster, and drive people
      places if they need it, and be patient with others, and..."    The Man in
      Glasses continued, but Montano drowned him out. He was terribly embarrassed to be the center
      of attention. He tried to smile in gratitude for the compliments, but he could do no more than
      purse his lips and then he was in front of a mirror, practicing smiling without opening his
      mouth, forever.
