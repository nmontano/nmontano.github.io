Emotionless faces streamed past him as he worked through the dense crowd as
      quickly as possible. He looked back and there was Kerber, still following him-closer now than
      ever. Montano had to move quickly. Kerber drew near.    "Attention," said
      a voice over the intercom, "attention, please. Be on the look out for a murderer. He is in a
      black trench coat, he is wearing jeans, he is wearing..." The voice continued to describe
      Kerber. Montano sighed in relief. Emotionless faces grew twisted with anger as they identified
      the killer in their midst. Montano spotted Myron, who remained emotionless.    White glowing eyes.    Children dying. The man with white glowing
      eyes. Everywhere and nowhere.    A dimensional rip and green lines spill
      out mechanically (he looks back frequently, and every time the green lines are flowing out).
      Incomparable terror. The man with white glowing eyes.    A child near the
      exit, an intended victim. "A Jehovah's witness wants to see you," said the janitor to the
      child. (Looks back, green lines ripping free). Child walks away. "Notice how I said 'Jehovah's
      witness' instead of Cheegorva Miktid?" His face drops. He's seen this movie before.    (Looks back, green lines).    Into the cold winter air.
      Shandoy? Need to get to the store from...yesterday? The beautiful blue flower.    (Looks back, green lines.)    Run.
