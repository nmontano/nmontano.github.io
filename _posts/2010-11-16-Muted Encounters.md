Roquelay and Krosbot entered the small black chamber and silently observed
      the artwork hanging from the walls of the triangular room. There was no ceiling; rather, above
      them they could see the soft light seeping in from the rest of the gallery. The chamber began
      to move, slowly, and only a couple of feet, back and forth, back and forth...    The bright lights of the dressing room temporarily blinded Roquelay as he
      opened the door. Heltroy turned around, her bright red lipstick screaming vibrantly.
      Incredibly excited by his arrival, she forced her way into his arms and pressed her lips
      passionately, ridiculously, against his. The embrace over, and his face now covered with her
      residual lipstick, he discretely removed the tiny scrap of food that had been inserted into
      his mouth with quiet disgust.
