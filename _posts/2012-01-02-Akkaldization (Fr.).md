Through a red tinted window, the bookshelves could be seen swaying
      precariously. Montano watched from his bed, his face registering no expression but deep within
      relishing the experience. It was a joy to watch the library collection teetering back and
      forth. At last the forces battling the shelf overcame it, and it tumbled into the next shelf,
      and that one into the next, etc. Dominoes. Montano found himself suddenly saddened because he
      had wanted to push over a bookshelf someday, but this was not to be in his immediate
      future.    He tried to tell several young girls about the library books
      collapsing, but nobody cared. As he meandered through the seemingly staged landscape, a
      strange dread came over him as he sensed a dark presence. There, not far away, was a tuxedoed
      man with a swamp face. True, he was within bounds, but Montano couldn't help believe that they
      crossed out of them occasionally. He couldn't make out what the swamp faced man was doing, but
      there was a dead bird involved. Montano grew uneasy.    The dogs ran up to
      him and he immediately began sorting them. It wasn't difficult to tell which ones had
      aspergers, for those were the ones that bit too much and were always repeating themselves.
      Those dogs bit him now. They bit him hard.    When Montano had left the
      dogs, he saw SAM unpeeling a potato like a banana. Montano followed suit with a carrot, and
      was about to deposit the peel on some particularly fertile looking soil. His hand froze just
      before dropping it, as he realized that he would be littering on-    "What
      are you doing?" asked the swamp-faced man.    "I thought this would be a
      particularly good place to deposit this peel."    "What?!" Another
      tuxedoed swamp-faced man joined the other. "You think just because we're different that we
      want your trash? How dare--"    Montano sensed this would end poorly.
      Knowing the swamp-faced men wouldn't be far behind, he ran.
