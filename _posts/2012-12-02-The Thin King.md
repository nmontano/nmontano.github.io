A very dark bar where Montano and the other are spoken to twice about what
      they would like to order. The second time 'round they are accosted by two large waitresses
      with unplaceable accents. Montano is worried that his food will be made twice and that some
      employee will suffer for this. But these are small matters as the place shifts in appearance
      and importance to being the central hub for The Men in White Masks. Of purposes unclear, they
      are nonetheless respected for holding a perhaps illusory power. Masquerading before a throne
      where The Thin King watches silently. Montano discovers when one removes his mask that they
      are indeed an ugly people, but first how about a slice of that decadent pizza? (Buffet
      sponsored by The Men in White Masks.)
