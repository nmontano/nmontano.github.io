Montano found Shastavitch under the streetlight. Shastavitch handed him the
      pizza and the payment of twenty dollars. Montano thumbed through the cash and gave him eight
      dollars back. Shastavitch took it and turned to the car next to him as its window rolled
      down.    "Yes. That's good enough," said a voice from within.    ***      Persian  : Alright, so how many children and animals do we have on
      board?    Officer  : 12 kids and 12
      animals.    Persian  : Damn! There's
      a risk we might lose some...    Captain
      Montano  : Yeah, we're definitely going to lose some if I'm captain.    ***    The nine stood in the subterranean chamber,
      waiting for the next foe to appear in the entryway from the catacombs. A member of the party,
      a small mage, pulled out two hairdryers and pointed them at the wall. He fired a shot onto
      onto the opposing wall, and with incredible speed it traced the hallway, arriving at a special
      door. The great white lizard emerged from behind it and began walking clumsily towards where
      the nine were waiting. "Hey! What's going on?" it said. When it was in sight, the mage fired
      the teeth at him.    Flawless victory.    ***      (Tigh strapped into electrical
      device)        No.
      6  : Sometimes I just look at babies and think: how am I going to eat them?    Tigh  : You're a monster.   (electrocuted briefly)      No. 6  : I think I would just cut it in half and eat
      the little bits that way. Kind of baby-like, right?    Tigh  : Shut your mouth.   (electrocuted briefly)      No. 6  : I'M GOING TO EAT YOU, SAUL. I'M GOING TO EAT YOU ALWAYS!
        (electrocutes him for longer duration)  
      Had enough? Good. Because first you're going to eat me!   (straps herself into the electrical device, seated on his lap)    ***      "Just dropping off these crab cakes," said the
      mailman as he handed Montano a yellow highlighter, who then signed it with a polite nod. The
      mailman frowned at the lightly hued signature.    "No. That won't
      work."  "What?"  "Your signature. It won't do."  "Why
      not?"  "Sign it again."  "No."  "SIGN IT!"    ***    "Ohhhh no you don't," said Roslin as she plucked the bottle of
      beer from the table. The high schoolers whined in malcontent. "Nope. You throw a beer bottle,
      you lose it." She gave a laugh of exasperation and poured the beer into a bottle of
      grass.    Montano turned to the girl next to him with a coy grin: "The
      galactic army was formed by Robert Elee in 1865 after the battle of Second
      Manassas."
