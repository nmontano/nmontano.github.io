The white car veered off the side of the road and flipped violently as it
      fell down the steep embankment. Montano's eyes widened as he watched the scene happen, himself
      driving immediately behind the now destroyed vehicle. Knowing that he must do something to
      help the poor victims in the car, but also that he was ill equipped to save anybody from the
      wreckage, he quickly dialed 911 to alert the authorities. "I should still get out and see if
      they're ok," he thought. However, the only place it seemed he could park was at the desert
      resort a mile down the road.    Arriving at the parking lot, he soon
      realized that he would have to pay for a room to be able to leave his vehicle there. Expensive
      as the resort was, Montano thought that it was a small price to pay to ensure the well-being
      of the people in the wrecked white car, and quickly ran into the lobby. Having paid for the
      room, he turned around from the front desk to see a beautiful family enter the resort and set
      their luggage down. Montano was particularly captivated by one of the daughters, who was
      similar in age to himself. It didn't take long for her to notice Montano's entranced gaze, and
      she approached him.    "So what brings you here?" she inquired.  "Oh, well, I'm just parking the car so I can go check on-"  "Oh, you mean
      you'll be here for the night?"  "Uh, well, yes, I paid for a room-"  "Well, then you must join us for the banquet in the great hall! Father, can he be at our
      table this evening?" Her father, who was checking in at the desk, turned and gave a nod with a
      big smile. "Oh, then you simply must dine with us! I don't know if it's a vegan dinner or not
      but you simply must be there!!  "Err, well, ok!" replied Montano. Though he wasn't a
      vegan, he was enamored with this beautiful woman and did not want to pass this chance up. His
      thoughts wandered back to the wrecked white car: "Well, the police are there, and I'm sure the
      people in the car are fine. I'll just check in on them after dinner."    Replete in an expensive suit, Montano entered the dazzling great hall. Soft   bossa nova   played as he wandered around the palm
      trees and waterfalls, the deep red of the walls strangely intoxicating him like an exotic
      perfume. He found the beautiful family at a table and seated himself next to his love
      interest. She smiled at him; Montano was in ecstasy. But, like an unwelcome visitor, the
      thought of the white car from that morning entered his head again. "It'll have to wait until
      after dinner," he told himself.    As the banquet was ending, the
      beautiful daughter grabbed Montano's hand under the table. "You know, my dad got my sisters
      and I our own separate rooms. I'd love it if you spent the night with me..." she said softly
      in his ear. Montano knew he had no choice. They left the great hall together and entered the
      cool night, heading towards her luxury suite.    "I still need to check on
      that car..." thought Montano. "They're probably fine...I'll look into it tomorrow."
