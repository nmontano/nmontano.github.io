The red fighter leapt high into the air as the tournament master froze the
      white fighter, pinning him to the ground. The red fighter halted at the top of his jump before
      crashing down brutally onto his opponent who gasped in pain. The crowds cheered
      enthusiastically.    "What you have seen here today," said the master, "is
      but a shadow of real power, power that strikes fear into the heart of anybody who stands in
      his way." The crowd hushed. "I give you...the green fighter!"    The
      crowds gazed in silent wonder as the green fighter emerged from darkness. In his hand was a
      twelve foot long sword. Sleek, deadly. No other fighter wielded such a weapon.    "And now a display of his power." The master raised the white fighter into
      the air, still suspended against his will.   Someday they will pay for these
      abuses  , he thought.    The green fighter readied his sword, and
      in a quick movement, sliced into the back of the white fighter. The crowd erupted.      The tournament ended, the green fighter made his way back to his
      domicile where the girlfriend of his brother, the red fighter, stood waiting at the door. He
      leaned in for a kiss but she recoiled.    "I guess, maybe not." The green
      fighter moved into the living room.    "They're going nuts for you out
      there," she said. He peered out the window to see people milling about just outside the door,
      as if they didn't know it was his house.    "We're going to need escorts
      to the next tournament."    Time passed. The green fighter and the
      girlfriend, merely black lines against a tan scroll made their way to the next town, escorted
      by five guards. The green fighter had noticed that one of them reminded him of somebody, that
      strange mustache...    "Sir," began that very guard, "have you ever met my
      lover?" The green fighter watched as a seductress entered into the ensemble. The mustached
      guard rubbed his finger on her lips and then quickly onto the green fighter's. "I...no, I
      haven't..." The green fighter collapsed onto the ground as darkness washed over him.    The moon split into a man kissing a tiger. Light slowly grew in the heavy
      blackness, illuminating where the green fighter lay tied to the ground. But these bonds were
      no matter! In a swift motion he swept them all away.    This was a plot! A
      plot to prevent him from fighting in the tournament! He dashed off to the stadium, hoping he
      would still be in time.    The door to the stadium was bolted shut, but a
      flock of ducks in military helmets flew down and began taking out the screws, passing them
      down the line. At the back of their formation stood the white fighter.    "You!" screamed the green fighter as he saw his enemy. "I'M GOING TO DESTROY
      YOU!"
