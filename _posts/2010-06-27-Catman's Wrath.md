Murmurs of discontent emanated over the futuristic workspace. Montano grew
      nervous. Nobody was taking the announcement well:    "As of today, all
      projects have been completed. We have finished far ahead of the schedule and there simply is
      no more work. We apologize for the inconvenience."    The dirty Romanian
      man seated next to Montano threw up his hands in disbelief. Everybody here needed the work,
      but Montano didn't. He silently prayed that nobody would find out the deeper reason for how
      all the work had been completed.    Catman, who was seated several rows
      ahead of Montano, rose from his chair and began looking around, his face full of rage. Montano
      did not know how Catman had fallen from his affluent position, but the fact that he was
      working here meant he must have lost most of his fortune and was in desperate need of money.
      Catman's eyes scanned the room until locking upon Montano's own. Sweat dripped from Montano's
      brow as Catman approached.    "YOU!" bellowed Catman, and with a quick
      motion grabbed Montano by the throat and lifted him from his chair. "Everyone, listen! This is
      the reason we have no work!" he exclaimed while pointing at the struggling Montano. "He is too
      productive! He finished all of the work ahead of time! He is why none of us will get any more
      paychecks!" A commotion began to grow among the workers as they gradually rose from their
      seats and approached while Montano desperately tried to release Catman's grip.    Montano's mind raced as he watched the malicious grins growing on the
      employee's faces. He didn't know how he was going to get out of this one, but he would think
      of something.
