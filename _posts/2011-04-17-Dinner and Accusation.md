Montano was stopped by a maitre d'hotel just outside of the elegant dining
      room.    "Did you bring a tote?"    "No," said
      Montano. What was a tote? The maitre handed him a dollar bill.    "I think
      you should get some more."    He entered the green dining room. The table
      was very large and with every place set, but not all of the guests had arrived yet. Risho and
      Shirsho were at one corner of the table, while several empty chairs away sat Merpam and Merjo.
      Montano took a seat across from them next to Ghala.    "What's a tote?"
      asked Montano.    "It's to tip the waiters. When they serve you, give them
      a dollar if they say 'I'd just like the soup.'"    Conversation progressed
      and was quickly steered by Merpam when the topic turned to hair.    "Can
      you even believe how wild your hair was as a kid?" she asked Ghala. "That stuff was all over
      the place! Big and wild." Ghala did not respond. "Now Mermat still sleeps with us each night
      and I can feel on his chest that he's got quite a bit of hair growing." This made Montano very
      uncomfortable to hear.    "Oh you and your hair! That's all you ever
      want!" said Risho abruptly. He help up a mirror to Merpam. "You just want to mcgovern
      hair!"    Much later Montano found himself among a very ritzy warehouse
      store. He had flown in with his bulky mechanical wings, which now frequently knocked over
      items from the shelves as he turned to maneuver through the aisles.    "Are you Satan?" asked a child who had approached him. His eyes were focused on the
      wings.    "What? No."    More children arrived. "He
      is!"    Montano flew away through jungles, marble ruins, and arrived at a
      school of philosophy in the clouds.
