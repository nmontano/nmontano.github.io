The last rays of sunlight were slowly fading behind the black forest
      surrounding the lake, which was only identifiable now by its crooked outline. Montano strolled
      leisurely onto the L-shaped dock, savoring the pinks and blues of the evening sky and the
      smells and sounds of the lake. As he looked into the water, he could see where the previous
      dock had sunk, and where the one he was standing on was already beginning to submerge. How
      long before another one would be built? he wondered.    The stillness of
      the evening brought peace to Montano. All was as it should be.    This
      changed immediately when Montano turned to find a large wooden jungle gym floating just a few
      feet off the dock from where he was standing. Not sure how he had missed this before, he began
      to examine it from afar, observing that it was really more of a home entertainment system; one
      replete with a computer, television and a couch. Montano blinked and found his cousin Mermat
      now seated on the couch, where he immediately turned on the computer and television, breaking
      up the natural silence with electronic din.    Mildly irked, Montano tried
      to ignore it and turned around to leave. To his amazement, the dock and surrounding rocks and
      trees had all been covered in thousands of post-it notes. As he looked around at the rainbow
      of paper, he noticed that each one had a very specific number written on it.    Merjo, Montano's uncle, approached him on the dock. Hoping for an explanation, Montano
      grabbed two post-it notes, one reading "1,246" and "67" and handed them to his uncle with a
      confused look.    "Oh, yeah, I got that done earlier," began Merjo. "I was
      taking the temperatures of everything and marked them down so we could know what it is like
      out." He continued on past Montano and joined his son in the floating entertainment
      system.    Montano did not understand.
