Montano stood up from his computer console in the forest and began scanning
      the other rows of workers until he found his supervisor.    "I'm going on
      break," he stated. His supervisor nodded her understanding.    He found
      himself walking along residential sidewalks, the orange glare of the street lights casting a
      hazy and comforting sheen over the cool summer night. As he walked, he soon noticed a fat
      child running further ahead on the route he was taking. He squinted to get a better image of
      the shaggy haired youth.    "Pakko?" he thought. He broke into a run and
      soon caught up with the elementary age student.    "It's been a while," he
      said as he caught Pakko's attention.  "They're coming again tonight, man. I've seen
      them already."  "Who is?"  "The Greys are."  "Oh yeah, I know,"
      said Montano with a smile. "Fire in the sky, right?"  "Yeah, man. Fire in the
      sky!"    Montano laughed and began running back into the forest. A wall
      had been constructed in front of the rows of computers, and a trash can with a sign hanging
      over it seemed to have drawn the attention of some employees. He went over to examine what it
      said, but its message was mysterious and incomprehensible. Baffled, he went to his computer
      and got back to work.
