Night. From an outdoors restaurant booth, Moptop, Jack, Ellynnorr and
      Montano watched Jim as he entered an empty store across the street. There was a short old man
      inside, presumably the janitor, and they began conversing. As they carried on, the man
      suddenly stuttered and began to reach for his throat just as a strange, pulsing swelling began
      in it. After moments of increasing agony, the neck finally erupted in a splash of white
      emulsion, and was quickly followed by similar explosions in his stomach and chest.    Jim walked over to the booth and set down the stack of Dave Linch dvds he was
      holding.    "Dude," said Montano, pointing to the store. "What was that
      all about?"    "Yeah, man, I don't know."
