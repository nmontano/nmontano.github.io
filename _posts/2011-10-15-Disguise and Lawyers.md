Night. A group of muslim women in burqas entered the illuminated carnival.
      They headed over to the carousel where a dance number was being practiced by a large number of
      Mexicans. One of the women found a grassy incline and sat down. A hand tapped her shoulder
      from beyond.    "Arabic or espagnol?" asked a short Mexican boy.    The woman pulled down her veil. "Psst. Hey," said Montano. "It's me.
      Remember?"    "Si, senor! Si!"    Montano was uneasy
      about this carnival. "If it was up to me, I wouldn't even go to Disney World. Something about
      the dinosaurs..."    "But, you're already here," pointed out Myron as he
      walked down the grassy hill. "And besides, your teeth are so small, who would even notice?" He
      gently bit Montano's arm.    Not far away in a school cafeteria, Gennaro,
      The Man in Glasses, and a student researcher sat quietly at different tables. The Man in
      Glasses was busy at work filing some peppers away while Gennaro sat staring at his lunch
      tray.    "You know," began the student, "I kind of wish I hadn't picked
      the bunker." Gennaro nodded, knowing he was referring to the one in the carnival.    "Yeah," said Gennaro. "I bet it gets pretty hot. You should have signed up to
      stay here in the cafeteria." There was a long pause before he continued. "But are you guys
      getting enough heat?"    The student gave him a confused look and Gennaro
      looked down again at his lunch tray.
