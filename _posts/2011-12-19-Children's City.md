...shivering, so cold...    ...rising up, he could
      see--Trussaydn. And the smiling face of Destinee. Bed moderately warmer. Sank down
      below...    ...bed much warmer now. The children are helping, making
      cardboard houses, a city spread out across the bed, around the convalescent Montano. Sinking
      below again...    ...a neighborhood. Hmong, Spanish, and Somali. With each
      turn of the head, a new neighborhood. Bed is on fire. The victory of heat. Sinking...    ...what is this bed? How strange, how foreign. What are these strange lands?
      But at least I can speak Hmong. Black quilts of cloud. I am a stranger and this is not a
      bed.
