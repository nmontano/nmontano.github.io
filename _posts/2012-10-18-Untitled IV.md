A man named W shot Montano in the face because he was an R just as his
      escalator was about to deposit him on his desired floor. Floating backwards to the bottom, an
      eternity away, he was joined by Mardecker.    "So are you ready to
      go?"    "Yes."    Montano punched a button on the
      escalator's console that caused the stairs to coalesce into almost a perfect incline. But the
      task of climbing it wouldn't be so difficult, as the stairs had been programmed into having
      slight grooves where one could rest one's feet during the climb. Mardecker and Montano began
      their ascent once again. Yet so near the top:    "This isn't going to
      work," stated Mardecker.    "No?"    "We're gonna have
      to go back down."    Montano wasn't the boss so he obeyed and they began
      their descent. The purpose of their climb made to wait-- some wine floating precariously in
      space now left to an uncertain fate as it tumbled gently within its glass,&nbsp; a
      backdrop of galaxies just beyond the space station framing it.
