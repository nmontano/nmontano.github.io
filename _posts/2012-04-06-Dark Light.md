"Who are you?"    "Brian."    "...Why are you here?"    "To watch Star Trek."    The room was too bright and Montano could not open his eyes as a result. But he knew he
      was with a stranger.    "Will you show that one episode
      with...heh...."    He stepped outside into the cool night where he could
      open his eyes without hesitation. "Peter!" he called. In front of his garage a large black
      labrador he had met before appeared. Montano carefully meted out 6 pieces of dog food and then
      without a second thought threw another handful down. "Goodbye, Peter," he said as he shut the
      door while the dog ate. There was a thin layer of snow on the ground.    "What were you doing out there?" came a voice as Montano reentered the house. Blinding
      light. Shut his eyes.    "Huh?"    "You know you can't
      afford that."    "To go outside?" Montano opened his eyes a crack. His mom
      was talking to him.    "Yes."    "Explain."    "It's just that you can't risk spending that-." Her voice trailed into the
      background.     So fucking bright.
