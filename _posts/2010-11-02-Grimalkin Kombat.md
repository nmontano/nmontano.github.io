Batcat sunk her teeth into Montano's arm. Screaming in pain, he grabbed the
      cat by the throat and tossed it against the wall. Her rage renewed, she lunged at him with
      amplified force and clawed his face vengefully. Montano managed to get his hands around her
      throat once more, but her amorphous neck evaded the force of his choke. A bite to his hand
      ensured her release, and Montano, now terribly worried and desperate, grabbed a door and
      charged at Batcat, screaming.    Catching the cat by surprise, he slammed
      the door down onto her small frame. His sense of victory was short lived though as Batcat slid
      out from under the door unharmed like a puddle of water. Amazed, he slammed the door onto her
      once more, only to watch as she easily slid out from under it again. In the following
      half-second when she leaped towards him, Montano realized that he was losing this
      battle.
