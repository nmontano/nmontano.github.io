The sterile operating room was quiet save for the muffled hum of a large
      light hovering just above the table. Two doctors stood pressed against the wall, looking at
      the skeletal man on the operating table. The man squirmed in excitement.    "Are you ready?" asked a doctor.  "Oh yes!"    The doctor
      approached and inserted a needle into the skeletal man's arm. He stepped back.    "Wow! Do you think...", the skeletal man began to shake his head back and
      forth as it slowly became two dimensonal, "... I could get out of this hot light?"    "Absolutely." The two doctors pushed the table back out from under the white
      light. The skeletal man began to jerk spasmodically. "What??" He flopped from side to side.
      "WHAT'S GOING ON!?!?!?" He screamed as the doctors quickly left the room.    The side of the skeletal man's head erupted forth with a river of white brain matter.
      Gasping for air, the skeletal man slowly crawled off the table, his naked body covered in his
      own juices. He stumbled out of the operating room and into the empty hallway hospital.
      (Erasmus noticed that the producers had covered his privates with his own brain matter. But
      can you do that and still show it to the public?) He stumbled down the hospital. On and
      on...    In a small mountain town, Mr T,&nbsp; stood atop a large
      platform, almost at the summit of a mountain. He was dressed in a large chicken costume. His
      supporters stood behind him as he prepared to give his speech. Far below the villagers waited
      intently for the voice of their leader.    One man grew uneasy. As he
      squinted up towards Mr T he noticed that somewhat discretely hid beyond him was an army of
      mounties led by Fox Mulder. As the man turned around, he saw that the entire village was
      indeed surrounded by the same red menaces. "STOP!" cried the man. "IT'S AN ATTACK!" The crowd
      erupted into panic (the skeletal man ran among them). Up above on the platform, a woman was
      thrown at Mr T, and mistaking her for his wife, Marlene, embraced her. But when he discovered
      her to be a stranger, who threw her up into the air and far into the mountains.    The woman landed in front of a large range of blue-white mountains, and
      almost drunkenly giggling, began pressing the single white sheet of linen against her body,
      her only article of clothing. Prancing alone in the mountains. Her face was never
      revealed.    "But really, dear, can we really be serious about something?"
      Panned over to a very tall, naked humanoid, whose arm was resting gently across the back of
      his lover, also naked, and with a third breast growing on her left arm. They talked and walked
      deeper into the mountains.
