Montano looked down into the basin of water. A red, intestinal creature,
      almost a giant head, looked back at him from the boiling water in which it cooked. It was
      horrifying. The consumption of lobster was a barbaric practice.    1.
      Remove organs from chest cavity (should come out in one piece).  2. Boil in
      water.    Montano found the dog from which the lobster had been extracted.
      A frail animal now. Where it's chest had been removed was now an emptiness. It walked, weakly.
      He befriended it. Walked with it slowly. Scratched his ears. Waited with him until the
      end.
