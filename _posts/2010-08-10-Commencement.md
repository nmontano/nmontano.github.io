The graduates sat, enraptured by the enormous television before them.
      Images of cold fronts and storm cells moved across the screen as the weather man
      explained:    "And for tonight we're under a severe storm watch, so we'll
      keep an eye on that. For tomorrow, conditions are perfect for a Shark/Bishop attack, but we'll
      give you updates as we know them..."    One graduate nudged his friend
      next to him.    "Is that like a bishop riding a shark?" he
      whispered.    The other imagined this in his head before nodding
      affirmatively.
