Montano seated on a picnic table outside a high school.    Canadian goose jumps down onto soccer field nearby.    -Look at that
      goose.    It changes, becomes immense and distorted. It begins to eat the
      trees, it is coming closer to Montano (who runs).    From a safe distance
      he pulls out his phone to take a picture. A muscular Chinese man has joined the horrific bird
      creature. Montano snaps a picture. Another. Another. The Chinese man has noticed and is now
      approaching him, now running.    Montano sprints. He is prepared to fight
      but will run as long as he can. The man not far behind him now. Montano darts across a busy
      intersection. A voice:    -The orgasm is an unyielding source of power,
      allowing one to run without exhaustion for hours at a time...
