Through the fortress and past the twirling wizards in lava, the girl found
      herself before a sickly horse in a cage.    "Pathetic," she mumbled.
      "Hardly an adversary."    A blue orb floated down into the cage and next
      to the horse's mouth, which sucked it up using its last remaining bits of energy.    A jolt seized the room, and ichor began surging through the horse's body, and
      with each passing moment it grew larger and stronger and more irate at the puny human that
      stood before it. Now the horse stood as tall as the vast chamber it was in, and just as the
      girl realized she would be defeated, an angry hoof rained down and annihilated her in a single
      blow.
