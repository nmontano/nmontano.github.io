  A woman, cold and
      without personality. She wasn't always like this, no, it was the result of a marriage. Sapped
      of her charm, her vices, she is a shell.                  A dark
      forest.                  "Can she be returned?
      Reformed."                  A flashlight shines through the trees where
      the girl wanders mechanically in the night. She scowls.                  "Bring her to the path."                  The light slowly shifts and she follows till she is now fully
      following the guiding light. The specks of color from the distant city announce a different
      future of a recollected past. She is grabbed, embraced, restored.                  Montano finds
      himself in front of a large plate of meat, the stuffed head of the beast mounted just above
      him.                    "So is this
      meat-gamey?"                  "Yes," says the
      girl.                  He takes a bite. Gamey
      indeed.                  ...                  The Mississippi flows rapidly through the canals of Minneapolis,
      relentless in its power and dangerous to the weak. A man, primitive but strong, rides a raft
      of unknown material down it while his love, a translated form of the broken girl, rides her
      across from him.                  The city seems abandoned save for these two
      travelers. It is not.                  Trouble. Scientists approach from behind. The
      primitive man watches as they come up beside her, and one, riding an inflatable mattress,
      injects a long syringe into her forehead. The primitive man does not understand. She slumps
      over. He stares.                  The scientist is beside him now, running
      tests. They pass a sign with a shark painted on it ("You can
      pass!").                  "Now," said the scientist, "when we're done
      and get back we can figure out the schedule and when we'll have a
      break."                  The primitive man feels the needle enter his
      forehead. A sharp pain then numbed. Blood falls onto his hands and though he has no fear, he
      knows that something is wrong, that he is slipping away. All is
      dark.                  Outside hell there is a diner. Inside several
      men, mostly fishers, are dining on crabs loudly.                  "Now if you aren't going to eat them legs, at least me get in on
      that," says one to his friend.                  They munch loudly,
      talking intermittently. All except Montano who silently understands, hunched over his dinner,
      that he will remain skinniest of them all.
