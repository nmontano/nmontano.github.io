It was the pesticides that were turning people into zombies. The police
      were involved as well. Nobody believed Montano when he told them, and so he continued to
      escape from one apartment complex to the next trying to keep just ahead of the hordes. A debit
      card (Bill's) flew in the wind.    An interlude with corinthian columns. A
      recently evacuated apartment. Fountains flowing, trash everywhere. Mixin bent over and when
      Montano had finished his first, he withdrew. She screamed, demanding he put on a new
             prophylactic. He threw the used one across the room, a
      slimy skin, an alien embryro.&nbsp;            He again tried to explain about the pesticides, but not even his
      parents would believe him.
