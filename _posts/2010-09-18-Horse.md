From the dizzying heights of the skyscraper desk, Montano looked out across
      the room at Miskatonic's slaves. Unable to pay their debts to the institution, they had been
      forced to do paper work to pay off their loans and were inhumanely shackled four persons to a
      desk. Unmoved by their condition, Montano looked far below and saw his prize winning horse
      being led by its trainer through the streets. The horse had collapsed after winning a very
      close race, and he and the trainer had thought it best to take it for a nice stroll so as to
      help it recuperate.    "Um, excuse me," began Montano as he turned to face
      a student near him. "Is there, you know, any way off this desk without jumping?"    "Hmm? Oh- no, there isn't. You just gotta get used to it."    Montano approached the edge and looked down at the ground far, far below,
      terrified.    He led the horse through the plush red carpets of
      Tantstrong's office as the sun began setting in the distance. Tantstrong was seated behind his
      desk, staring incredulously at the man and beast that had infiltrated his office. Montano's
      phone rang and he received a text message from Lavick that filled him with sadness:    "Sorry, baby. I tried."
