The band wrapped up the opener as Konan waltzed out onto the set.    "Thank you! Thank you!" he said. "Now I'd like to get serious, people, and
      talk about what's on everybody's mind." He grinned. "I MEAN WHAT'S WITH THOSE SEX SCENES ON
      BATTLESTAR GALACTICA?"    Footage of the show began to play. Each scene
      was consistent in showing Lee and a lady friend floating upwards into the air ("But look at
      the leg angles! That's impossible!" laughed Konan) and proceeding to rip off their clothes off
      and copulate.    After each romance there would be a period when Lee and
      his friend would have to deflate from their gigantic bodies, like a balloon losing air.    After one tryst, Starbuck's large pinata head sat in a barber chair. Lee was
      much smaller than her and wielding an immense razor that was easily bigger than him.    "I'm still going to be ugly sometimes," said the pinata head. Lee took the
      razor and scraped large bloody lines under her eyes.
