A science professor made her way through the fluorescent orange lighting of
      the basement tunnel, not noticing Bernie and Montano standing idly and watching her as she
      passed. Her presence indicated to the duo that they were in some sort of academic building,
      but what kind specifically was yet unknown. She moved by them swiftly and entered one of the
      many doors in the hallway.    "Strange," remarked Bernie. "These doors are
      never open..."    Montano walked up to a different door and slowly opened
      it. He shrugged at Bernie and they entered. Cautiously making their way through bare rooms
      leading to even more doors, a growing heaviness came over the duo. Finally, as they went
      deeper and deeper into the belly of the building, they came to one door that caused Montano to
      feel an incredible sense of dread just by looking at it. Cracking it open bit by bit, his
      fears were confirmed by the slightest outline of a man's arm, alerting to him that somebody
      had been indeed been waiting for them. But this was not just anybody-this was somebody far
      worse...The Horrific One. Consumed by fear, Montano slammed the door shut and turning to
      Bernie with terrified eyes whispered: "Run."    Montano did not waste any
      time as he bolted past Bernie. Without thinking he burst through doors at random, eager to
      escape the terror that was on his heels. Making his way through the labyrinthine underground,
      Montano spared a second and looked back to find that Bernie had gone missing. He didn't have
      the time or desire to speculate on his fate-The Horrific One was surely close.    Wildly swinging doors open, Montano came across a very large classroom, empty
      save for one young Asian boy in the back row. "Detention," thought Montano. Thy boy noticed
      Montano's entrance, and, desperate as he was for attention, began addressing him. As Montano
      furiously brainstormed an escape plan, he carried on a half-hearted conversation with the boy
      while running through the room.    "I don't get why I'm always in
      detention."  "Yeah."  "Other people do bad things."  "Ok."  "Have you ever had detention?"  "Sure, sure."    Then it
      struck Montano-the observatory was connected to this room! He quickly found the right door and
      dashed into the plush lair. He had to get to the top, and so he bolted for the metal spiral
      staircase, all the while continuing his non-conversation by yelling between the rooms as he
      scrambled upstairs.    "I guess detention isn't that bad."  "NOPE."  "Where did the teacher go?"  "UH HUH."  "How much
      time do I have left?"  "HMMM."    As Montano reached the top, he
      heard a voice from the lower level of the observatory address him:    "The
      game is up. Come down."    But it wasn't The Horrific One. No, it was a
      female dog trainer, but Montano knew her purposes were malevolent. A jolt of resolve came over
      him as he considered his fate-he wouldn't give up, no, if he was going out he was going to go
      out on his own terms! Grabbing a metal circle, Montano fastened it to the stair's railing and
      jumped on head first. With an inexplicable burst of momentum from nowhere, the circle began
      sliding down the railing extremely slowly; but this lack of speed did not deter from the drama
      for Montano. He shut his eyes and spread his arms out. He flew.
