Sometime during the night Link had transformed back into his youthful
      self.    He walked behind the inn and encountered the two bullies he was
      expecting. He threw a bomb at them, but they weren't complete fools and ran away from
      it--towards him. Rather than flee, he charged back at one of the bullies and began pushing him
      towards the bomb. He struggled against the weight of his adversary as he pushed him closer and
      closer to it, hoping he would get him there before it blew. The fuse now burnt in extreme
      colors, signifying it would soon explode. At last! Link had the bully situated just over the
      bomb.    But so was he.    The bomb exploded. Link
      lost 1/4 of a heart.
