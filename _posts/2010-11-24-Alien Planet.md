The adventure ended, Montano felt he needed to see for himself what the
      alien looked like beneath his disguise. "Show us your true form!"    "You
      won't think it will frighten everyone?" asked the alien.    "Nah! Change!"
      Deep within, he could feel the stirrings of love.    Montano searched and
      found a secret access route to Aether. He transported to the evil alien home planet and stood
      on a cliff where, suddenly, millions upon millions of alien soldiers ran towards him. They
      moved as one, a heavy sheet stretching indefenitely. There were small openings between the
      units, and as they approached Montano delicately weaved his way through them. Despite his
      skill, he didn't last long, and as soon as he hit a soldier he was returned to the beginning
      of the level. The aliens ran at him again, and he again tried to dodge them but the task
      proved too great for him.    Transporting back to the alien and the
      others: "Guys! I found a secret zone! I think if you can beat it something sweet happens but
      its not originally in the game!" He warped back to try the level again.    Later, he entered the alien college commons area and noticed that people were being
      recruited for a blood drive. He started to turn around so as not to be roped into it, but
      realized something crucial:   they may be able to tell
      me if I have AIDS or not.      He got in line with some alien
      students and prepared himself for the exchange with the nurse.    "So
      you're looking to give blood?" she asked.    "Yes. But, uh, I gave blood
      recently so I'm not sure how soon I can give again."    "When did you last
      give?"    "Maybe five months ago?"    "That's
      fine."    "Err, but I had drank the night before."    "...so?"    "I know you're not supposed to drink the night
      before."    "So you had a hangover when you gave blood? That's fine. You
      can still give."    Montano left and the nurse began talking to the next
      person in line.    "I didn't really get drunk," said Montano who returned
      to the desk.    "..."    "I only had like one drink
      and I didn't even get a hangover."    The nurse stared at him.
