For the second time into the snow battered hotel, somewhere near the
      Nebraskan town Montano had seen before.    Cop walked up to the
      window.    'Now you didn't meant to go past us like that did you?'    'No,' said Montano, who had already been pulled over twice for
      speeding.    'Montano!!' said the other cop, exiting his car, shirtless.
      He motioned to a nearby store. 'Ice cream! Distilled!'    A dark room. Two
      large ham sandwiches, several feet long, prepared by a mother for Johnny.    'Oh yes,' he said. 'Never have I seen such wonderful asses such as these.'    Montano glanced over at the sandwiches which were nervously shaking. Live
      pigs between bread.    Johnny removed the bread from one and mounted it,
      thrusting aggressively into the orifice on the pig's back. The pig squeaked anxiously.
      Johnny's thrusting intensified and he began to pull back the skin of the pig as he came closer
      to climaxing, revealing the dripping BBQ flesh beneath.    Cops in the
      rear view mirror again.    Snow.
