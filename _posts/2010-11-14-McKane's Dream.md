"The portrait of my dead wife stared at me coolly from its elevated place
      on the mantle above the roaring fire. Elizabeth came and set a candelabra down on the bed, and
      I was reminded of the murder.    'Oh I've done it again,' I say.    There is a beautiful naked woman standing next to my bed, looking down at me.
      I am aroused and pull it out. A wire hanger in my hand, I violently force it into her (she is
      a horse). Rhythmic. Plateauing, feta cheese spurts forth in ecstasy."    (Montano: "I'm not going to sleep well now..."    In another room,
      the local news was covering the baseball game. Kane and Don were treated to field level seats,
      and the reporter decided to interview them. Don's long blond hair seeped out from under his
      baseball hat. It was assumed that they were dating, and Don smiled, revealing a mouth of
      crooked teeth. As he moved in for an on-air kiss, Kane adjusted her face ever so slightly so
      that he only hit her cheek.)
