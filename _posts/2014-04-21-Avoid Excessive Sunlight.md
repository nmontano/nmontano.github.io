the voices of children screaming in the dark    heat.
      extreme heat. the pillows had found but were also websites for the two universities (KU,
      K-State). nothing to celebrate, indicators of his defeat.    the blanket
      rolled up. some sort of google device. a chair with a lot of interest but really though what
      does it do? such a fucking headache. id like to know more about what exactly this product does
      but    my whole body aches    the voices of children
      screaming (isnt it a bit late?)
