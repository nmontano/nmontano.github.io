Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer walked down the hallway and away from the
      camera as the Seinfeld title icon came up. The funky bass music that had been playing quickly
      stopped as the camera panned to under a nearby table where a Log Lady was sitting. She spoke
      staring directly into the camera: "I've done everything I could to level the playing field,
      but finally, after all these years, they will pay for bringing men into this world."    A commercial came up and Montano's nose started bleeding, but he was
      distracted from this unwanted occurrence by an extremely loud jazz rendition of the ABCs
      coming from upstairs where his mom was eating a box dinner.    "What's the
      deal?" he asked The Man in Glasses who was in the next room.    "She just
      gets really pumped up about those Double D Dinners."    Montano returned
      to the problem of his nose, but just as he was about to run to the bathroom Seinfeld
      returned.    George and his girlfriend stood outside of a
      skyscraper.    "But Jove bringing Venus to life..." trailed George. "What
      about Aries?"    "He's the god of love," said the girlfriend as she leaned
      in for a kiss. George recoiled    "Whoa, whoa stop. Ok...we could eat at
      that place...Triticale."    A commercial came up and Montano went up to
      the bathroom. On the way he met his mom descending the stairs and he strongly cautioned her
      against trying to tickle him. A spurt of blood shot out of his nose and across the room. "See
      what happens!?" he said.    He positioned his head over the bathroom sink,
      allowing his nose to empty its contents.    "Must achieve the vital
      drip..."
