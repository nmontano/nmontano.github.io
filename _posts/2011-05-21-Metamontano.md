Montano awoke and immediately sat down at his computer to type in his
      newest entry-another Fern and Kale dream. But what to call it? 'Fern and Kale'? No, that had
      been used already.    His excitement was great as his fingers flew across
      the keyboard. But still-what title to give it?    (Fern: "Excuse me,
      madame, but would you mind squaring your feet off?")
