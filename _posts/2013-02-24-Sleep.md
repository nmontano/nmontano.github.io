In a very thin place, Montano lay in his bed as the orange light of the
      street lamps illuminated the room, rendering it in a mysterious chiaroscuro. The slats of the
      blinds cast a pattern against the wall and down on to Bunny sleeping next to him. He turned to
      look at her, analyzed the pillows (dictionaries) on which her head rested.    Montano turned to the window. Would she have enough words?
