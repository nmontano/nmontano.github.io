Montano exited the house with his cello and opened up the trunk of the car
      where his family was waiting with Mercourt and Merrem.    "Hey, I think
      there is a ghost in your house because the TV was on when I walked in," he informed Mercourt
      while placing his instrument in the trunk.    "Don't worry about
      it."    He slammed the trunk and his family, apparently forgetting that he
      needed to go with them to play at church, drove off. All the same, he was glad that he
      wouldn't have to play. As he watched them fade into the distance he decided to meander slowly
      through the snow covered streets.    He turned a corner and discovered
      Bernblood in a t-shirt and soccer shorts.   Holy
      shit  , thought Montano. They shook hands and then immediately stood back to back
      and clasped hands once more.    "What brings you here?" he asked
      Montano.    "I was supposed to play but I'm not anymore."    They began doing bizarre flips and turns on the snowy landscape as the sun
      set. When they had finished, they released their grips and Bernblood turned into
      Whinoble.    "What song was it?!?!" asked Whinoble enthusiastically. He
      began jumping high into the air, doing outrageous flips. "Is it that one with the flutes that
      is like WOO-DEE-DOO-DOO-DEE-WOO-," he began spinning in mid-air, "DOO-WOO-DEE-DEE-DOO?"    Perplexed, Montano informed him that it wasn't.
