"Wait! Are you married to Paula Abla?" asked Kevin as Harry held him up
      against the wall.    "What? No. Shaddup." His fist met Kevin's face.    "How about Sarah Jones?"    "No." Punch.    "Marcia Henderson?"    "No." Punch.    "Bridget Heinz?"    "No." Punch. Blood trickled down Kevin's
      face.    "Rachel Timms?"    "No." Punch. Where had
      Marv gone?    "Look," said Kevin. "You gotta stop this. My blood shouldn't
      be flowing like this."    "What are you talking about, kid? What kind of
      blood you got?"    "Type F, and it should only be coming out of my
      kidneys."    "Nah nah that's all wrong. It don't come through there. Shut
      your mouth."    Punch. Punch. Punch.
