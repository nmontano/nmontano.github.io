In a room with no walls, Montano sat in his desk. Next to him sat his
      classmate, Keedra. An exasperated teacher entreated the ruffians in the desks in the back to
      behave, but to no success.    The teacher approached Keedra and Montano
      and handed them $15 in monopoly money for their good behavior. Tears of gratitude streamed
      down her face. She bent forward to be at eye level with Montano.    "Thank
      you," she whimpered. "Thank you."    From his position, Montano could see
      down her blouse and noticed that a large chunk of flesh in the middle of her breast was
      missing.    ***    There were four fennel seeds
      beneath Montano's fingernail, and they were delicious.
