Left on a white cushy hill.    Helping the
      children.    Right on a different hill.    Helping the
      children.    (  There are no children!  )    Montano crossed the street and entered his neighbor's house where he was going to be dog
      sitting. The house was set up like a large bunk bed, with each floor a bed. He nestled into
      some large pillows and turned on a large television.    Sci-fi movie: A
      large dark ship moves through inky clouds. Credits roll as each character is shown briefly on
      the deck of the vessel.&nbsp; Two opposing factions fight for control of the galaxy.
      Unexpectedly, a member of the enemy group lowers into view, her strange goggles a focal point.
      Behind her, one of the enemy fleets flies in and attaches itself to the vessel, huffing
      mechanically against it like a demented vacuum. A metal sheet on the ship rolls back like a
      curtain and millions of tiny insectoid ships burst out. The battle has begun-    "Excuse me," said a girl Montano lusted for, "but I was hoping to watch a
      movie in here."    "Oh. Well, how about this one?"    "No. I have a friend coming over. He-"    "Ah. I see. It's ok, I'll
      leave."    Montano, Moptop, Jack, Emilio, and Barpham enjoyed beverages at
      a pub.    When Montano got back to the house, he fell what felt like
      several miles from the highest bed-floor onto the crotch of the girl's boyfriend.
