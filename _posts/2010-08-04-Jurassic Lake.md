Montano stepped out of the rowboat and into the lush, prehistoric
      vegetation of the waterless lake. As he wandered about the dense foliage he grew increasingly
      upset by how staged it all looked. He was supposed to eat the plants, but it was so painfully
      obvious that somebody had prearranged them so that he would eat only certain ones. For
      example, there was a very typical triceratops plant he was supposed to eat just plainly laid
      out along the path he was taking. The plant couldn't have got there by itself; somebody
        put   it there.    Growing more irritated by the minute, he was suddenly approached by the figure of Ian
      Malcolm, who began addressing an invisible entity:    "So, um, uh, you,
      uh...you want   me   to eat, the, uh....the,
      uh   dino  ...   dinosaur plants  ?"    Montano leaned back in his
      chair, looking at the draft of 'Jurassic Lake' he had just finished. The experience had been
      real, but now it wasn't. He was back in the Einstein room- Saul was zoning out on his left,
      and the voice of his supervisor, Kjelldeb, spoke from behind:    "You had
      just four papers at the end and I didn't change their scores," she told him. He took the
      papers from her hand and turned back to face the computer. There was no 'Jurassic Lake' entry.
      He turned off the computer and left.
