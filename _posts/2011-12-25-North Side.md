It had been some time since Montano was hoodwinked by the teenage vampires
      and led blindly through the elaborate tunnels of the public school system. He had come very
      close to meeting his end but had somehow slipped away unharmed to his domicile.    Selihan. Selihan. Selihan.    The name, imprinted on the
      side of a large mechanical flattener, moved up and down rhythmically.    Selihan. Selihan. Selihan.    The flattening aspect of the device was
      a large loaf of bread (sesame seeds prominent). It pushed down on other large towers of bread,
      though they never diminished in height.    Selihan. Selihan.
      Selihan.    Montano watched the flattener at the Selihan plant across this
      street from his apartment window. Usually the towers of bread were there. Sometimes it was
      just a gray garage door: SELIHAN.    "Look at it," he said to Ghala.    "Why would I care at all about that."    Montano took out
      a yardstick and gave her three lashings.
