  Montano  : You know I was
      reading that a lot of doctors have money problems.    Ghala  : That's not true.    Montano  : Yes it is! I read it in the paper.    Ghala  : You can't even know that.    Montano  : What? Why the fuck not? It
      makes sense-they get money and then they hoard it or don't know what to do with it and blow
      it.    Ghala  : You're wrong.    Montano  : Fuck off! You're
      wrong!    Ghala  : No, you
      are!    Montano  : I just read this
      in the fucking newspaper! Why can't doctors have money problems? WHAT'S SO HARD TO BELIEVE
      ABOUT THAT?    Ghala  : I'm not
      going to agree to anything until you look at this. [points at half-eaten cauliflower on
      plate]    Montano  : Fine. I don't
      care. [silence] Why? What's the deal with that?    Ghala  : Admit that it's a universe collapsing.    Montano  : What?    Ghala  : [silence]    Montano  : [silence] Fine, it's a universe
      collapsing.    Ghala  : Well,
      doctors still don't have money issues.    Montano  : OH COME ON.    T.V. Announcer  : It's new! It's better! It's Pig On A Casket! Your pet
      pig is going to be thrilled when you bring home this great huge coffin for it to stand on!
      That is, unless it wants to remain Pig On a Hot Bus Roof Going Through Arizona! [abominable
