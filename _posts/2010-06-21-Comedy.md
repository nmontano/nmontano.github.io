A curious rhythmic pounding was emanating from the intercom system in the
      dark green hallway. Montano stood listening to it while standing among some short bookshelves.
      It was then that he noticed a tall leprechaun standing just a few feet away from him. This
      gave him an idea. Now was his time to shine!    "Sounds like whoever is on
      the other end is watching   Erarstrehead  !"
      he said with a grin while pointing to the intercom. The leprechaun's face registered no
      amusement from this poor attempt at humor. Montano's smile quickly faded, and he headed
      upstairs.
