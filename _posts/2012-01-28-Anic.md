Through deepest night the titanic made its way among uncertain waters. A
      sudden jerk and she found herself having run aground land. She came to a violent halt. Montano
      and Gridin fell forward off the boat and onto soft grass. The light of a nearby gas station
      was the sole source of illumination. It was a gas station Montano knew well.    "Hey! Well we must not be far from home if we're here!" he noted. Confidently, he jetted
      forward in the direction of his house only to come to a quivering stop. The darkness and dread
      of the night engulfed him. He swiftly turned around and made his way back to the gas station.
      That light in the abyss.    Meanwhile, on the super star destroyer
      Executor, Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader looked with puzzlement as one of their control
      monitors began to freeze over. The camera zoomed out to reveal that in the wake of the
      starship, a net of ice had been set by Frost Vader, which now took behind it a train filled
      with entire star systems.
