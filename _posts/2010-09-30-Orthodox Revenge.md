"Ladies and Gentlemen...THE SUPERNATURAL!"    On cue,
      the eastern orthodox bishop walked through the curtain of beads, stopping briefly to make two
      brief bows before continuing on into the 1970s-style basement. He came upon a very ugly man
      whose face was like that of clay.    "You have done well in this pairing,"
      said the man.    "Yes. It will be a successful marriage. But what are the
      prospects for a desirable offspring?"    "What? I thought you would
      know!"    "Me? That was your task!"    "Listen!" cried
      the man as he grabbed the bishop by his cloak. "This will be my family's last chance for
      revenge. You will not destroy this for me!"    Farther back in the
      basement, Montano was ashamed because he had bowed in return to the bishop despite having made
      a point of never bowing to anybody.
