The two rock squares, the only ones that were left, sat contemplatively on
      platforms over the holes to oblivion. The airbike race incident had left Square No. 5
      completely disillusioned. Never had he seen such a complete and utter failure. Was there any
      reason to go on? Sure, his protege, the Comb Child, had much to live for. He had his whole
      life in front of him! Even now, after the tragedy, he was off playing. But for Square No. 5,
      the future seemed bleak. Then, as though his thoughts had been read, Square No. 2 began
      speaking:    "Square No. 5, do you want me to kill you?"    There was a long, heavy silence followed by his hushed reply:    "I-I
      don't remember..."    Square No. 2 lifted himself up from his platform.
      Square No. 5 had given a clear answer. He floated over to him and without another word began
      to furiously pound his friend with his own square frame, quickly pulverizing him. When it was
      all said and done, a swift breeze came over the platforms, pushing the crumbling remains of
      Square No. 5 into the darkness of oblivion.
