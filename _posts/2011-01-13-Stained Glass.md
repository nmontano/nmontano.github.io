The first glimmers of daylight were just beginning to spill from the
      horizon. The cabin was quiet as Montano watched the light grow through the gnarled branches in
      the forest. He had been assigned to this cabin with Beckermann, who now lay upstairs with
      Heltroy in post-coital slumber.    How Montano hated them! How desperately
      he had wanted a role in the Twin Peaks musical! How certain he was of being cast as
      Rocco!    No. But of course the two adulterers upstairs had been chosen.
      How typical!    He was in the organ loft of a sanctuary, holding two small
      doves in his hand. Around their wings were cardboard casts that he knew would prevent flight.
      Montano dropped them off the side, and fearing their end, began to look away just as the doves
      broke their bonds and soared gracefully towards the stained glass windows. The music of the
      organ surrounded Montano, and he wept tears of joy and ecstasy.
