The purple boots reached his knees, leaving a space of milky white skin
      before the intensely short black shorts resumed the task of covering the naked flesh. Then an
      all too short black t shirt barely covered his pecs, leaving a midriff that was both toned and
      blinding. A purple cape draped behind him to complete the look.    Death
      was ready to play.    "Hey!" he said to Dmoon. "We're the only ones in
      here!" He scampered over to the speaker system and queued the music ('Scaramanga's Fun House')
      required for his favorite game. As the ominous pulsing filled the room, Death threw Dmoon a
      yellow nerf gun. "Go wait outside."    Death (actually Montano deep
      within) quickly positioned himself behind a corner near the entrance. There was not even a
      chance for Dmoon to retaliate and he quickly lost the game (foam dart in the face). But Death
      wasn't ready to stop playing.    Death hid under a piano. As the music
      flooded past him, he waited with nervous anticipation for his enemy to appear, waiting,
      waiting, to pretend kill him over and over and over again.
