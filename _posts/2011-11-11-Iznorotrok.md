After the envelopes were passed out to each of the guests, Professor Plum
      slipped away into a nearby room. He opened it hastily, eager to find out if he was the
      murderer. It read:    "You have HIV. Reveal to the others that you have
      HIV."    ***    The T-rex stomped through the library,
      and for the nth time Montano threw a thermal detonator at it to halt its path of destruction.
      Like clockwork, Jim approached and defused the bomb. Montano grew angry. The T-rex briefly
      became a reading mentor, during which Montano wondered why Jim didn't understand the threat at
      hand.    ***    Montano opened the dryer to see a
      large plastic elephant peering out at him. A thunderous boom was heard upstairs and he rushed
      to investigate.    In the toilet another large elephant was slowly being
      inflated, its eyes growing larger as it filled the toilet. Montano popped it, but it was soon
      replaced by a device that began inflating balloons with Disney characters on them    ***    Edro bent down in the snow to repair the wheel on
      Montano's car after having purposefully damaged it. The sky was pink in the late evening
      light, and Montano savored it before letting his fist slam into Edro's back.  -That's for trying to teach me how to dougie!
