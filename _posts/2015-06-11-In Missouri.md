Stopped on an interminable trip through/from Iowa (connotations of false
      Mason City emanate deep). Protestations regarding the need to stop, something sinister. A
      shack, rain falling, grime. A game cycling back on itself. Basements, darkness.    Her generous ass paraded around the room. The only chance for freedom. A
      green, glowing square situated very significantly on her lower left cheek. He grabbed the
      laser gun and fired. Her ass was quick but finally impact. Like an ancient column, the green
      square cracked slowly working its way into the flesh. Green light dims, extinguished. Gently a
      flower placed in a perfectly circular crater where the disintegrated ass had fallen
      away.    A suburban house's garage where in front of a car's trunk where a
      mother collapses to her knees dead as Wagnerian strings soar. With his foot Montano pushes the
      corpse underneath the car, then kicks the villain with a snide grin to the audience, the work
      ends on a note of glorious resignation.
