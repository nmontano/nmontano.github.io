        <p>The orchestra sat patiently on the stage waiting for a greasy violinist
      talking in the audience to join them. In the meantime, Montano looked at his piece of sheet
      music. It was a picture of a room, but from the way it was drawn he knew that it would have no
      gravity restrictions.    “How many red heads are there here?” asked the
      director. Quietly, everyone looked around, counting.    “Am I a redhead?”
      asked a middle aged violinist as she turned to face Montano. He looked at her hair. Save for a
      small patch that had been dyed purple, the rest of it was brown.    “Yes.”    “Ha! Of course he’d say that,” commented another violinist.
      “He’s new.”    The piece began and dancers weaved in and out of the
      musicians, some walking up the walls. To each redhead they seemed attracted, like a magnet,
      yet were always repelled before coming to close. Montano continued to slowly play his
      oscillating fifth while watching the dancers ebb and flow.    Suddenly, he
      was face to face with…Fern! Which of us didn’t feel his flesh creep? Montano stared into
      those dark beady eyes and realized that it was not actually him, but a woman in Fern’s mask.
      Nevertheless, an impish grin grew on her face and she began to violently pluck the strings of
      Montano’s cello as he played his part. Finally she left but only to be replaced by another
      She-Fern who also plucked his instrument recklessly. Montano gave a quick look around. Fern!
      Fern! Fern!    The auditorium was gradually becoming a gymnasium, and
      students were beginning to flood in for lunch. He continued playing his part, watching them,
      the masses, enter.    A bell rang and a purple wave shot out of the gym
      and onto all of the students who hadn’t managed to arrive on time. Didn’t they know what was
      at stake? Didn’t they know that Montano now had all of their powers?</p>
