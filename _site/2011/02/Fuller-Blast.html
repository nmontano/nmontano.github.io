        <p>Othello (Pov) paced restlessly in the garage. Iago (Montano) draped an arm
      across his shoulders and began speaking in gentle tones to his distressed friend, joining him
      in his walk. Around them played a soundtrack of farcical carnival music.    After a long bout of this, Iago finally whispered to the director at the side of the
      garage:    “I think maybe you cut a little bit too much out of the script.
      The characters feel a little bit stripped of their identities. The story is mostly
      gone.”    “Shut up,” said the director. “The audience will love it.”    Iago looked at her. She was far away on the lake. A crocodile swam towards
      her raft. She would die.</p>
