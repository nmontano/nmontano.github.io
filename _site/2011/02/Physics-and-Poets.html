        <p>As Montano looked at
      the physics test, he had a brief recall of falling out of the plane and into enemy territory.
      He returned to the test. “What is Arminia the capital of?”   Ireland  . Montano
      was so confused, though he was certain this was the correct answer. Wasn’t that what the two
      Irish people had been talking about in the other room? The next question included a drawing of
      interlocking squares. “Comment on the angle.” Montano winced in confusion.        His leg caught that of the person next to him. The teacher?
      Bugs.          “Let me study with you,”
      demanded Biron as he stepped onto the wharf in pursuit of Persee Shellee.
                “Me? Well, you’ve tracked me this
      far. Fine.” Biron was elated.           “But
      how will I contact you?”          “Send me an
      email. I’m here. I’m there. I’m everywhere and nowhere.”          Later, the poets were all seated on a concrete slab in the middle
      of a park under darkened skies.          “So-what do we all want to work on?” asked Shellee. He looked at
      Biron. “I know   you   want to work on ‘The Painter Fish’. How about you
      two?”          “We just want to work on our
      computers.”          “HEY!” screamed an
      objector. “Am I the only who thinks its odd that you even have computers? It’s 1833!” Nobody
      paid him any heed.</p>
