        <p>With the score to one of Ghandel’s concerto grossos in hand, Montano turned
      around and approached a large swimming pool. He turned up the water’s heat to high. The idea
      was to get it to a rolling boil and then lower the heat so that it bubbled gently. All around
      the classroom, students were busily taking a test.    Montano neglected
      the pool for a moment too long, for when he returned to it a small hurricane had formed over
      the waters. He lowered the heat and gathered up the hurricane in his arms. He took a bite out
      of the top as he headed over to the garbage can where, with some difficulty, he disposed of
      the storm. One student smirked as he watched the ordeal.    Montano turned
      back to the pool where  a cyclone had formed over the water. He ran over and began
      strangling the twister. He disposed of it.    Returning to the pool he
      noticed that the scuba diver action figure was slowly sinking to the bottom.     “I think our diver died,” noted another teacher in the room.  “What
      now?” asked Montano.  “…9-10 women.”    Montano walked over to
      a shelf where a multitude of female dolls were situated. Most looked like regular girls, but
      some were robots and some were cups (“Pretty gay,” said Montano as he handled one). He grabbed
      ten and prepared to throw them into the pool.    He became a woman and
      realizing that she would have to jump into the treacherous pool, said the Lord’s prayer while
      looking out across the troubled waters, the sun setting in the distance. She knew she might
      die. Quietly, one of Ghandel’s largos played softly on an organ.</p>
