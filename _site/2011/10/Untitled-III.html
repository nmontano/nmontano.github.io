        <p>“Of course, once you have all of them in the buses, we would most like it
      if you could save a couple of them for us…for the pot.”    Montano
      approached the tour bus and stepped on. How many did she say to take? Coolly, Montano
      addressed the three female gingers in the front of the bus: “Would you guys mind following me?
      There’s a different transport we would like to put you on.”    Excited,
      the gingers got out of their chairs, not knowing what this new promotion might be for, and
      followed Montano off of the bus. He watched the tour bus start up and drive off, filled with
      beautiful specimens of humanity on their way to the slaughterhouse.    It
      was late evening, and the final shimmers of daylight were faded into muted colors. Montano and
      the gingers made their way down the field and to a large hill.   Something isn’t
      right  , thought Montano as he looked around.   Their transport is
      gone  . They looked at him eagerly and he smiled to hide his confusion. “Well let’s
      keep working our way down the hill.” He would have to deal with them swiftly.    In the distance a large mass of people dressed in black migrated around a
      circular cage. Montano watched them curiously as he and the gingers headed down the hill to
      the forest at the bottom. He could see the hunters lurking in the tall grass, but was
      confident that the girls could not. “Alright! If you’ll just head on…head on into
      the…forest…” These were people! What was he doing? He ran.    A voice
      from behind stopped him. “Hey what do you think you’re doing leaving these girls alone?”
      Montano turned to see a man dressed as a zombie approaching, the girls not far behind him.
      “Uhh, I…look. You all have to get out of here now.” He ran again.    Unsure in the dark of where he was heading, he fell into the mass of black cloaks as they
      walked around the metal cage under a silver sky. From their chant he ascertained that these
      mysterious beings were  Poebellam Christians. He would join them. Give up his old way
      of life. No more humans to the chop. We will all join in our new glorious day, when we leave
      what we were and join our brethren in new life! And then, then we will have cause for great
      celebration.</p>
