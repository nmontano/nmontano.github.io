        <p>Left on a white cushy hill.    Helping the
      children.    Right on a different hill.    Helping the
      children.    (  There are no children!  )    Montano crossed the street and entered his neighbor’s house where he was going to be dog
      sitting. The house was set up like a large bunk bed, with each floor a bed. He nestled into
      some large pillows and turned on a large television.    Sci-fi movie: A
      large dark ship moves through inky clouds. Credits roll as each character is shown briefly on
      the deck of the vessel.  Two opposing factions fight for control of the galaxy.
      Unexpectedly, a member of the enemy group lowers into view, her strange goggles a focal point.
      Behind her, one of the enemy fleets flies in and attaches itself to the vessel, huffing
      mechanically against it like a demented vacuum. A metal sheet on the ship rolls back like a
      curtain and millions of tiny insectoid ships burst out. The battle has begun-    “Excuse me,” said a girl Montano lusted for, “but I was hoping to watch a
      movie in here.”    “Oh. Well, how about this one?”    “No. I have a friend coming over. He-“    “Ah. I see. It’s ok, I’ll
      leave.”    Montano, Moptop, Jack, Emilio, and Barpham enjoyed beverages at
      a pub.    When Montano got back to the house, he fell what felt like
      several miles from the highest bed-floor onto the crotch of the girl’s boyfriend.</p>
