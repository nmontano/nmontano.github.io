        <p>Montano carefully pulled into the curb of the neighborhood street and
      switched the car into reverse to adjust his parking job. The side view mirror tore into
      wallpaper, but unshaken, he shrugged and got out of the car and headed down the street towards
      home. As he looked back to evaluate his work, he found that his car had been swallowed
      entirely by the rip in the wallpaper. With a sigh of exasperation he headed back to find it a
      new parking space.    <em>**    Jack and Montano headed
      up the stairs in the park to begin work on filming ‘The Joy Machine.’    “Look!” cried Jack. Montano pointed the camera up and filmed a cloudmap of the United
      States circa 1861.    **</em>    The sandwich shop was dim
      and packed. Montano worked his way through the crowd of hipsters, but upon spotting Waine in a
      booth, quickly retreated to another wing of the restaurant. He found Bolle holding a
      baby.    “Hey! And who’s this little guy?!” asked Montano pointing
      indicatively.    “My son.” replied Bolle.    “Oh! And
      what’s his name?”    “Lettuce.”    “Lettuce?”    “Yeah. You must not have heard that the first time you met him.”    Montano left the sandwich shop and returned to the main part of the mall in
      hopes of heading to the bookstore on the lower level. But he could not, for the stairs had
      been taken away.    ***    Doppe inserted the tube
      into Montano’s arm and turned on the valve. Blood rushed quickly into the glass cube.    “Now you gotta watch it,” warned Doppe. Curious, Montano turned the valve,
      reversing the stream of blood so that it flowed back into him. Now aware that this was
      potentially dangerous, he turned to Doppe with a frightened look.    Doppe
      realized what had happened, and turned the valve again to reverse it. Too late. “RUN, DUDE!”
      he cried. They dashed into separate rooms, Montano still attached to the machine. From around
      the corner, he watched as a giant blood ball formed in the vessel and grew larger. Finally the
      container grew too small and the blood ball burst forth out of it. Without thinking Montano
      ran forth and grabbed it in mid-air.    “YEAH!” he exclaimed.    “Did you get it?” asked Doppe, returning. “AWW YEAH!”</p>
