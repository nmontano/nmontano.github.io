        <p>Red glare intensely penetrates the marble columns and polished floors of
      this grand palace basking in the sun’s decline. Everything drenched in this crimson haze,
      unnecessarily joined yet enhanced by the palace lamps which have been lit, perhaps,
      prematurely. Deep in the rafters of the palace, Iago watches silently as Claudius takes his
      place for-what? That which will catch him. Iago hugs the prince and realizes that this has all
      happened before.    There! Under a thin veil of water lies the dead king,
      illuminated strangely by the final rays of the nearly extinguished sun. So preternaturally
      silent is his rest in this watery tomb that the entire room, nay, palace screams in a mute
      reverence. Iago adjusts his position in the rafters to find the prince’s chambers behind him.
      Iago is gone. At the sound of an approaching car, Hamlet sets his book down on the bed and
      looks out his chamber window to see arriving what his ear had first sensed. A slight sigh
      escapes from him, and with a heavy air he speaks to all times and all troubles: “Why does it
      feel that all I ever do is brew tea?”</p>
