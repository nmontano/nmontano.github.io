        <p>Teeth descending on poplar (a rapturous sigh escapes from her lips).
      Unadorned skin, a gentle hand holding on glass. Eyes.    Round and round
      the structure they swam, carried by yet somehow oblivious to the water supporting them, as
      though it were just moving ground. Neither could they be disturbed by things past or yet to
      come, for here they had been granted amnesty by time and the stars.    The
      quest had been arduous and protracted to this point. But now, as Montano beheld the princess
      in this strangely reflecting pool, all of his past exploits and the personalities that
      accompanied them slipped quietly into the walls as a kind of white noise-loudly silent,
      present yet unobtrusive. How many revolutions he and the princess had made round the structure
      he did not know. But deep within he was filled with a certain knowledge that, though he loved
      the princess, and she him, this was but a temporary allowance granted by fate, and that a
      single breach into temporality would shatter this edenic night. They would be pushed into
      different realms, different ends, perhaps never to be united again.    The
      princess gave a slight gesture away. Montano’s eyes locked on hers. She meant to part. True,
      her destiny did stretch beyond this ecstatic now, but only so long as she continued down her
      path. “No,” said Montano. “Please don’t. Love is the only good thing that there is always more
      of.” Much convincing wasn’t necessary. The two lovers swam on in the eternal island.    Time lurched forward. The room: changed. Its company: returned. Montano
      reentered the room to pick up the cordless phone he had left behind. The friends in the room
      all watched as he grabbed the phone and then suddenly turned to them. With a quick gesture he
      indicated the small, tight shorts he was wearing. “Now   these   are hot pants!” he said.    Wild laughter
      and cheering.</p>
