        <p>Back in in the south of France, Montano was seated at a table with a family
      he knew. Across from him was the grandmother, directly to his left was young Guillaume. Behind
      them at the sink was the mother who did not speak a word of English. Montano had made eggs for
      breakfast.    “Bon, non?” he asked.    “Ouais! Ouais!”
      cried Guillaume.    “C’est tres bon,” said the grandmother with a
      bite.    The mother sat down and began eating. In attempted English:

      altar and hopped onto the table and out of the kitchen, splattering blood onto the walls and

      for it. Jack shook his head in dismay.    The calf appeared in the doorway
      and Montano extended a hand which it viciously bit and held onto. Montano screamed in pain and
      began trying to shake it off just as a strange movement rummaged in his pocket, and he looked
