        <p>It was an oppressively hot summer day. The sun hung in the sky like a cruel
      deity, scorching all who toiled below. Montano was under a street lamp watching his egg
      friends jump and play around. They were all named Eggsley, but he was still able to
      differentiate between them. Occasionally he had a sense that some of them didn’t really want
      to be friends with him. All the same, he enjoyed watching their antics.    All was well, save for the heat, until Montano’s favorite egg, Eggsley tripped and fell
      on his rear. When he stood up, a visible crack had formed. Eggsley began to cry as he flopped
      onto his belly and pounded the ground with his fists.    “Hey now,” said
      Montano. “You gotta be careful. Stop rolling on the ground like that!” The crack in Eggsley
      grew larger and a curious Montano decided to stick his finger in it. Eggsley split apart,
      revealing a quivering mash of a white flesh. Montano paled.    He looked
      back to the other eggs, all of whom had also received cracks from their rough and tumble play.
      The Eggsleys began to scream, for the intense heat from the sun was now able to penetrate
      them, cooking them from the inside. Montano’s eyes widened. One by one they fell to the
      ground, exploding apart and revealing more piles of white flesh. Montano took a stick and
      began poking around one of the piles to reveal a dessicated chicken fetus within. He poked
      another to find the same. The third pile contained a fried fish fillet.    Montano slowly backed away from the dead eggs.</p>
