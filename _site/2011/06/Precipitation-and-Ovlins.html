        <p>The rain came on swiftly and shrouded the neighborhood with a blue tint.
      Despite the heavy downfall, Montano’s glasses remained completely dry, much to his
      surprise.    The neighborhood was set up into rooms by street. Montano
      steered his wheelchair car further north only to discover a massive snowstorm on the street he
      needed to traverse. Stepping on the accelerator, he slowly pushed his way through piles of
      snow, careful to avoid running into the plows that were also working the area. Behind him a
      wrecking ball was clearing away some heavy drifts, and Montano stepped on the gas to escape
      being hit.    The next street was a living room with glass windows on
      either side that looked into jungles. Two young girls named Ovlin were staring at each other
      and saying “HIII!” back and forth. Their eyes fell on Montano as he entered the room.     “Who’s that?”  “Povlin?”  “Better not be.”  “Ancer?”   “Cancer.”  “Cancer Man.”</p>
