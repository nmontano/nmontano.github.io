        <p>Lightning flashed in the distance as Montano ran through the humid night
      towards his car. He hated driving on the interstate at night during storms and still had
      several hours to go before reaching Mason City. When he got to the parking lot, he noticed
      that the buses were still there and climbed on board one of them.    A
      bright flash blinded him momentarily. The policeman who had put the camera in his eye backed
      up, saying: “Careful now, everyone. There’s a black man on board.” Restrained in the corner
      was a black man in an orange prison suit.    “You,” said Sundermark as he
      spun Montano around. Ack! Sundermark! “Get to the back of the bus.” Montano complied.    He found himself violently thrown into a chair once he had reached his
      destination. “Do you know why you’re here?” asked the interrogator. “We do. We’ve seen it all.
      Everything. Now answer us this. After you fucked, did she give you a green or a gold
      bracelet?” Montano looked at the bracelets in his hand. He didn’t need to lie. He had a good
      record of his romantic engagements and none had ended in a bracelet.    “Neither. That never happened. You guys are full of shit.”    “Ex-excuse me?” The interrogator pulled out two sharp metal rods. “Do you know what we do
      with disrespectful kids like you?” He placed the sharp point in front of Montano’s face. “We
      gouge out their eyes.”    And then the interrogator was gone and Montano
      saw the man responsible: a guitarist.    “What the hell was that all
      about?” asked Montano.    “It’s part of our band’s ‘trust nobody’
      message,” replied the guitarist amiably.    “Well, ok, but you’ve really
      gotta drop the eye gouging.”    The guitarist shrugged and Montano felt
      that his words would not be heeded. On the way back to where he had planned to sit, he
      encountered Sundermark. “Hey why don’t you go back there?” asked Montano as he pushed his
      shorter enemy. “It’s fun. You’ll like it.” Montano pushed him again and then moved past him.
      Behind him he heard Sundermark say: “Em, we got a chicken.” Montano did not fear
      repercussions. He didn’t care anymore.    People and muppets he knew were
      seated in a dark corner of the bus and Montano slid under a large square to reach them. “Don’t
      all clap at once!” he said to their locked eyes. An electronic cricket was heard.    Montano took a seat next to Heltroy and Jack. Though desperately needing to
      tell somebody about what had happened he remained silent for he felt nobody could
      understand.</p>
