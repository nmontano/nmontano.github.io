        <p>His body was situated somewhat uncomfortably against the marble steps when
      Acker straddled him and pressed her lips against his. Too surprised now to notice the step
      digging into his back, Montano returned the embrace until Acker’s body suddenly pushed
      violently into his.    “Was that you?” she asked. Montano shook his head
      as a man peered out from behind her, grinning. Was that…?    The grocery
      store had been handing out cheese samples, but rather than using a new toothpick for each
      square sample, they had simply been reusing the same one. Mildly disgusted, Montano downed the
      cheese and returned the stick to the grinning man. As he left the store he quickly recognized
      the man behind the counter. Hadn’t that been…Fern?    The bedroom was
      dark save for the glow of neon lights. A tarantula crawled out of its cage, and Montano,
      suspecting it to have a temperament similar to a cat, reached out to pet it. He was more right
      than he knew, for the tarantula violently leapt onto his face, sinking its fangs into his
      skin. Screaming, he ripped it off only to have it recoil violently back at him. Once again,
      Montano found himself enmeshed in a violent struggle against a disproportionately strong
      creature. Back and forth they went, with Montano throwing the spider away again and again only
      to have it return and begin the fight again. Riddled with bite wounds, Montano finally managed
      to shove it into the hall and shut the door.    A Kale was sitting in a
      dark corner of the room.    “Is that your spider?” asked Montano. “Why the
      hell did it do that?”    “Well,” said the Kale looking up. “Did you clean
      his cage?” Montano shook his head. “If you clean the cage, then you’re the man.”    The Kale stood up and went over to the cage to clean it. As Montano watched
      him, he saw the image of a beautiful girl sleeping in bed as a large insect’s honey glazed
      proboscis edged its way closer to her cheek.    Is this how I will be
      reborn? wondered Montano.</p>
