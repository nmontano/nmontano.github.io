        <p>“They will be taken. They have already been infiltrated.”    In dense marsh, the natives moved swiftly towards their common goal. Grouped into threes
      so as to provide a solid defense, they kept ever alert as they looked about for the enemy.
      Their faces were painted with exotic blues and yellows, their bodies similarly decorated.

      escape. Hansona boiled under a blank face.    “Ah, hmm. Well, if I
      press…no. Why won’t, why won’t this work. If I try…no. Maybe if I…”</p>
