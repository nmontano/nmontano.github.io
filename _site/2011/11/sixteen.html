        <p>Through the glass ceiling of the sky scraper, No. 6 could tell that the
      entire structure was being overturned.    “Here we go!” enthused the aged
      Brian through putrid yellow teeth. She shut her eyes tightly as the building plunged headlong
      into the sea.    When it was all over, Brian and the girl exited the
      building to find it wasn’t a skyscraper at all, but the back of a commercial building in
      downtown. It was only a ride.    “I can’t…” started No. 6. “I can’t take
      this anymore. The games, the charade…”    “Hey now,” said Brian as he
      came up from behind. “It’s alright.” His hand stroked the skin of her back where it opened in
      the dress. Gently. “It’ll be fine.” Montano slipped his hand into Brian’s. “Everything’s going
      to be fine,” they said.</p>
