        <p>On the dreary late winter landscape of a realized game board, The
      Astronomer Prince sat in his throne amid the chill air. Four majestic stags stood on either
      side of him. They all watched intently as a pathetic, completely naked figure shuffled closer
      to them.    Montano’s arms were bound together but he had no information
      as to why.   Perhaps  , he thought,   The Astronomer Prince might
      help…      Montano halted just before the throne. The Astronomer
      Prince eyed him coldly, betraying no thoughts by a gesture or look. He stood up, walked
      forward and bowed slightly to meet Montano’s face.    “You will not
      remember any of this.”    Montano was grabbed by behind by Krood and
      pulled away from the scene. He became stiff, robotic, completely subject to the whims of his
      captor. While she held him with one arm, the other was furiously shoving jams and other
      preserves into his mouth. When she had succeeded in this first effort, she used her free hand
      to wildly search for and then clasp his crank, winding it furiously. Away and off! The
      mechanical Montano jolted forward to the overflowing pot of grain. But how annoying that the
      water was going to fall on the hot stove! Speaking of hot surfaces, split an eggplant in half
      and throw it on a sun baked surface, and in a second the skin will just slide off, somewhat
      violently even. But what greater way to spend a movie night (Blue Monday) than with this
      delectable dish, perhaps served with a little blue cheese?</p>
