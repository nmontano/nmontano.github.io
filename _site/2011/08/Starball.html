        <p>The ball was like the ship. The cloudy, edged surface of the star destroyer
      was matched perfectly with that of the large ball. Despite the rough sides, it had no trouble
      being pushed along furiously by Pootan as he explored the immense starship. No corridor was
      left unexplored as he traveled, though in search of what remained a mystery. A brief foray
      outside of the ship lead him to an icy landscape, no doubt similar to his Russian homeland.
      But he did not stay there long before he had rolled his giant ball back into the ship.    A flux in gravity and a narrow entry opened. Pootan carefully slid through
      the tiny slit, dropping down into an immense white room before disappearing into yet another
      room.    “Is he contained?” asked a shadowy voice from the intercom.    “Yes,” said the beautiful Russian spy as she appeared from an entryway.
      “Mama’s at the wheel.”    Where the hell was Moptop? Montano dashed around
      the same room in search of the promised escape pod. But where the hell was it? Quietly did he
      search, for he could hear Lavick rehearsing the Misktanic choir in one of the rooms.
        An octet,   thought Montano, though the piece remained elusive. But where was
      the pod!? He heard Lavick:    “Are you going to keep sneaking around out
      there or help me rehearse?”    “Ah, um, yes.”</p>
