        <p>The plush footstools extended for miles down the underground passageway.
      Dressed in wedding attire, Emilio and an unfamiliar blonde ascended the first of the series
      and began the long matrimonial procession down the tunnel. They moved very slowly at first, so
      slowly that behind them Montano felt it necessary to give a curt  -Ahem,
        andante?   to suggest that they quicken their pace. For the rest of the long
      walk, the bride would shoot contemptuous looks at Montano.    The tunnel
      lead gradually into a blue forest, and in the distance the flashing lights of police cars
      signaled unrest. As the procession approached, masked soldiers ran dutifully past them among
      the clear white lights from the military trucks. There had been an accident. Montano observed
      that at least it had been over quickly, as evidenced by the clean layers of dismembered brain
      strewn about. He caught site of the face of Frank, a fisherman, as the military vigorously
      tried to remove it from where it had fused with the pavement.</p>
