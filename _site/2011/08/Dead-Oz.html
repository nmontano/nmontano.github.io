        <p>The Oz had mistreated the girlfriend for too long and now he was going to
      pay for it. A fistful of rocks in hand, the attacker approached the Oz and with staggering
      force smashed his fist into the unsuspecting face. Blood splashed out in all directions. While
      the Oz was still recovering from the blow, the attacker began picking up the rocks which had
      been dropped after the punch. The Oz regained his bearings and lifted a leg backwards to kick
      the attacker’s face while his head was still to the ground (“Look out!” screamed Erasmus). But
      the attacker was smarter, faster than the Oz, and before the foot met his face, he had already
      gathered the rocks in his hand and struck another devastating blow. The Oz collapsed onto the
      ground as blood gushed forth in a heavy stream. His head jerked and tweaked as the blood flow
      increased. Finally he began melting slowly into the ground, sinking into a pile of green
      matter indicative of another reality.    “Hmph,” said the attacker. “Only
      a false Oz.”</p>
