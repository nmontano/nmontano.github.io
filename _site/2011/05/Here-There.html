        <p>There was chocolate all over his hands and for this Montano suspected he
      could be arrested. He tried to cover them from open view, but there was no place to put them
      without soiling his clothes. Continuing on his way to the bakery, he was stopped by two
      kids.    “We’re going wherever you’re going,” they said.    “Me? Ha! Not where I’m going!”    With that he entered the women’s
      bathroom in the bakery.    It was extremely crowded and Montano noticed
      that all of the elevated cage showers were in use. Needing to clean his hands of the
      chocolate, he began washing them in a nearby urinal. When he was finished he noticed a large
      rope ladder on one of the walls and began climbing it. A violist climbed next to him but did
      not speak. Montano looked up and saw that the ledge the rope ladder lead to was also extremely
      crowded. Finally at the top, he pulled out his cello and began to pluck the strings which were
      incredibly out of tune. A boy cringed at the sound.    “What WHAT!!”
      screamed Montano.</p>
