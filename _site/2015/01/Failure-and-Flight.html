        <p>The arrow gun fired into the heads of the three teenage girls. Two, a
      success. The third–why was she still alive? They began talking about their boyfriends, and
      Montano joined in the conversation briefly before catching up with his situation.    It was all fucked up. His comrades, so close to the highest level of the
      building, had run out of ammo. Now, rumblings below of the betrayed could be felt. They were
      trapped. It had been worth a shot, but there was no chance to succeed now. Death by firing
      squad.    He remembered the field of dogs. Looking up into the great
      expanse of sky, the giant blue nebula the animals worshipped pulsed. They stared utterly
      mesmerized. A stranger came to each of the dogs and removed their one glowing eye. Montano
      looked over at the pug, a companion of uncertain loyalties. A leaf was over his head.    ‘Do you still-“    ‘Shut up.’ The pug leaned down,
      exposing he still had his glow eye, his source of power.      The building. Montano and another middle aged woman in glasses raced down the stairs. A
      wrong turn into a room with a record player. Gunshots above where once they had all waltzed.
      Music began to play.      He remembered the seduction. Laying on
      a bench, chewing gum. Some children and their mother approached. He offered them gum. They
      returned soon after.    “Would you like to take a break,” began the
      mother.    “A break?”    “From the chewing.”    Montano caught the euphemism. He made it to their house. She was an enemy. He
      ran. But now he knew how to enter the tower.      Down the
      endless stairs.      And it’s time, time, time…      They put their shoes on. Montano slipped his atomic white sneakers onto his
      feet. The woman froze. ‘I love this song…” They sang along.  <br />
            And it’s time, time, time…      Into the street. The woman was gone. Do i need this salt jacket anymore?           And it’s time, time, time that you
      love  …    The street. A mass of people. Passport to Mexico. Was
      he married? He slipped into the crowd.      And it’s time, time,
      time…</p>
