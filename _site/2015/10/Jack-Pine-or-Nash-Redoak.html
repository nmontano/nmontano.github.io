        <p>For the millionth time two postcards of disturbing art in his hand.    It was simple. You held on to them and when the horror (usually the one in
      the artwork) came from behind you just needed to show them the card. Otherwise, darkness.
      Death?    It was always after the first horror. He would lose the second
      card. Montano knew what would come and was no longer uneasy. It would happen again after
      all.    The skinny faceless man was coming.    Montano
      rested against the blue bricks of the dark chamber. Heltroy, either aware or also subject to
      the approaching horror sat down on his lap to face him. A moonlight spread across her breasts
      which were secured in a bra of ornate black pattern.    “Well,” said
      Montano. “Why not?”    He removed the bra to find another thin net
      beneath. Removed, another invisible bra of spider silk. Montano struggled to remove it all, to
      place his lips on her before the faceless man arrived.    Near the
      surface, the question of the name of the tree detective.</p>
