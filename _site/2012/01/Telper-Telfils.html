        <p>A hand burst into the wall of hay and pulled out a dwarf who had been
      snooping about town, trying to get the gossip. Now he stood before the town for his public
      humiliation…    Meanwhile, Montano and Sermoo II were just arriving
      after an extended and complicated stay at a very dark furniture store where the former had
      been attempting to set up a career/romance with a mysterious male figure over the
      computer.    Where the town was gathered, an attractive woman was busy
      giving a lap dance to the dwarf for all to see. It was surprisingly repetitive and seemingly
      rehearsed. A flash of her breasts sent the crowd into lustful pangs.    Montano turned away from the spectacle to find a small bundle being handed to him by an
      unknown figure.    “Baby,” grunted the stranger. “Yours.”    Montano took it and realized that not only had the attractive stripper given
      birth after finishing the dance, but that this child was in fact his own. The bundle was a
      chipotle chili pepper and Montano began unwrapping it.    “Wait,” said a
      female holding a serrano pepper bundle. “We need to switch tops.” She was right, because
      Montano had a serrano top and she had his chipotle. They exchanged. Sticky white liquid
      dripped from it.    Montano unwrapped the pepper to find a neon blue baby,
      his child. It did not cry but looked intently at his arm and gently smelled it. Montano looked
      at the baby. The pepper bundle had become misshapen and he tried to reform it to better hold
      the infant but to little success. “How the hell do you fold these things anyway?”</p>
