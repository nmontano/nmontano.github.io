        <p>And now it is with a vacant compliance that we move among the chic
      geometric abstractions forming the walls and streets of this city, whatever it is. Everything
      is out of proportion. The towers, too tall, too skinny. The sidewalks, so long. Yet in the
      unseen and perpetually setting sun we find ourselves.    Montano’s parents
      approached from down the road. Nothing remarkable in this save that they were being followed
      by that most foul creature–dare we speak his name? Clad in a black suit, black fedora, and
      those perfectly circular sunglasses, he is the very model of a scoundrel. Of his deeds we will
      not speak, of his philosophy we will not even allude. Let the dread and disgust of his name
      wash over you, poison you, so that you may never encounter this loathsome shade of a
      man–Lifa.</p>
