        <p>For perhaps the hundredth time Montano and his team entered the Zone to
      explore it in search of an item not yet known. The Zone was a house, though who can say that
      the forests surrounding it weren’t a part of it’s strange matrix.    “Check out the upstairs,” ordered The Man in Glasses. Montano obeyed and began to climb
      the crooked wooden steps. At the top was a absurdly big door that was more than 10 feet wide,
      he estimated. With a harnessing of strength, he pulled it open, slowly, to reveal a dusty room
      filled with smooth shafts of wood.    A small opening across the way from
      him. A head appeared from below.    “BANG!” screamed Montano as he pointed
      his hand-gun at it. Pabeem grinned.    Another head appeared behind it.
      “BANG!” Beem.    Another head. “BANG!” Jobeem.    “Why
      are you all just smiling there? I just shot you. I won.”    As if he
      wasn’t there, Pabeem and The Man in Glasses began talking intently despite being enemies.
      Montano fell to his knees.    In a later iteration of the Zone, now a very
      large mansion, Bond and Anya Amasova burst out of the burning mansion of the lesbian SPECTRE
      official. Falling into a Thunderbird, a kind of boat, they crahsed down into the cerulean
      waters below.    “Wait, there is something I must do,” explained Anya. She
      hopped out of the boat and James sped it around into a discrete location.    At the top of the hill where the mansion rested, Anya trimmed a a tree into a burning
      Thunderbird. A distraction. As SPECTRE agents spilled out of the house they immediately tried
      to douse the flames as Anya hopped back into the boat with James and the two sped off into
      deeper waters, surely to a night of endless sex and caviar.</p>
