        <p>As Montano spilled the bugs onto the windowsill, he admired their diversity
      and almost athletic appearance. He looked around frantically for a larger bottle to contain
      them and was having no success when he realized he needed to run to the basement. When he
      returned, fish bowl in hand, those magnificent bugs had scattered throughout the room. His
      heart sank as he saw the task ahead of him. He grabbed two large green bugs who had remained
      on the windowsill and put them in the bowl, immediately filling about half of it. He would
      need a bigger bowl but there simply wasn’t time. He continued adding bugs to the mix, many of
      them being immediately devoured by the green ones. He took a tiny Elmo doll and threw that in
      as well and the bugs attacked it with unusual ferocity. The bowl was overflowing and the lid
      for it was too small. Still, he threw it on top hoping it would keep a few of the beautiful
      bugs inside. A strange noise from the basement followed by a pop up window: “DOSE MONTANO” A
      communication from the big bug downstairs. Montano shuddered as he realized now, as the bugs
      looked at him with greedy eyes, that they would try to poison him.</p>
