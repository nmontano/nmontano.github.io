        <p>Hundreds of go-karts flooded the roller coast. Timing the jump right, Bond
      leaped successfully into one and rode off. His adversary, a goofy woman, followed suit,
      probably 20 or so karts behind him.    Bond turned back. No sight of her
      yet. He hoped Madame Secretary was alright in the mansion he had left her in, and that the
      zombie horde was heading in the opposite direction. Bond turned back again. There: advancing
      now in a red kart, was his enemy. She fired at him and he returned it. Both misses.Â 
      She was advancing. Bond took another shot. Damn! Curved to the right. Another. Curved to the
      right. Bond adjusted. A hit.    The roller kart came to a halt at the edge
      of a forest. Strange sounds emanated from the darkness. Bond stayed still, steeling himself to
      do battle with the undead horde he heard slowly shambling towards him.</p>
