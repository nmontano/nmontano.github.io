        <p>Belle grabs from behind, guides him. Ballroom is spinning. Peter Pan,
      intoxicated, lets himself be directed. Quickly as that he has a new love and Belle like a face
      in a lamp is knowing but not willing to accept the truth that she is competing for his
      affections and losing.    Pan can’t keep this up for long. With Jasmine
      now the vortex through which his love is received, his ability to stay neutral is increasingly
      diminished. He sits on a couch in a movie theater behind an even more cartoonish man who is
      talking about something that isn’t very funny. We’re in some strange comic book. Belle, a
      beastly akaname, climbs onto the arm of the couch next to Pan as the flickering lights of the
      film flash against their bodies.    “Hehe. That’s ok. No. I don’t think
      so.”    The arm of the couch is now moist with bath water.</p>
