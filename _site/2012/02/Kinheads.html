        <p>One of the three was wearing a hat made partially out of a pumpkin.
      Peculiarly, it looked like half of his head was in fact made of the orange squash. However,
      this was not to his advantage as Montano could clearly see now that inside the skulls of the
      other two were two similar pumpkins–throbbing and thinking. Of one mind and one
      purpose.    “Montano, do you want to team up with me against Bernie in
      pinochle?” asked one of the pumpkin heads.    Never mind that. Montano
      couldn’t get his thoughts off the large video screen displaying a close up of his mouth with a
      subtle emphasis on a very small pimple near his upper lip.</p>
