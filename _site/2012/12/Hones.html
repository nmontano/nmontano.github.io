        <p>Looked at his watch. Twenty minutes till eleven.    His
      phone buzzed and Montano turned it on to reveal a picture message from Moptop, one of him in a
      full winter mask (couldn’t see his face at all) and accompanied by the text: “Get down off
      your swap self.”    Montano knew he was referring to the jungle gym in the
      background.    “Ok, Scarecrow.” Montano chuckled inside.    The three girls on the couches across from him (was he their baby sitter?) sat looking
      around the room, occasionally at him. The blond girl pulled out some yellow pants.    “Wait, where did you get a second pair?”    The other two
      girls came up to him with a phone. “Listen.” Montano leaned in. Only a strange watery, static
      sound.    “What is it?”    “An angry catfish.”    Montano kept listening, and sure enough there came two gruff barks. He
      immersed himself in its majesty.</p>
