        <p>Everybody recognized Jason because of his hockey mask. So when he would
      walk in to a playground and hold up two fingers, everyone would run, praying and hoping they
      wouldn’t be one of the doomed.    One finger. Three fingers. Two
      fingers.    Blood. Screams. Death    And then one time
      Jason held up four fingers. (  How unusual  , recognized Erasmus). Jack was
      among the unfortunate to be within the sphere of Jason’s potential victims. They scattered.
      And for the first time, Jason didn’t catch up with them. One caught him running the wrong way.
      He didn’t come back.    As Jack panted, catching his breath, he knew now
      that his struggle had just begun. Four fingers had been shown. Yes, he could run, maybe even
      for many years. But still…    Four fingers.</p>
