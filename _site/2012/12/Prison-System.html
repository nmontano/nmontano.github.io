        <p>The prison riot could be seen raging behind the soundproof glass, the same
      barrier that kept the prisoners safe from the more deranged specimens within.    On another side of the glass sat a middle aged woman, an employee of the
      Rathgnore Corporation. A guard, in essence. She looked down at her desk–possibly at work,
      possibly at nothing.    In yet another section of this high security block
      was a telephone. A prisoner snuck up to it, picked it up and asked a question to the female
      guard. She replied with a noncomittal response, but one that said ‘I’m not paying
      attention.’    He channeled the phone so that it would flood into the
      headphones of the deranged prisoners in the block: a group of zombie like figures standing
      mostly in drab brown robes.    What he did he say? We can only
      infer:    The prisoners slowly began to chant in unison:    “We want pokemon and hellchaos. We want pokemon and hellchaor. We want…”    They were shifting. Now large demonic dogs, reeking of rotting flesh and with
      terrible human heads in their mouths that looked out with dark eyes.    “WE WANT POKEMON AND HELLCHAOS. WE WANT POKEMON AND HELLCHAOS. WE WANT…”</p>
