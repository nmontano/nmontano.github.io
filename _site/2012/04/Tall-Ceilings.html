        <p>The dark chambers of the mansion were sparsely illuminated by a subtle neon
      blue light from a source unknown. A few luxurious divans were scattered about the spacious
      lounge. A canadian goose rested atop of one.    The Goose House was
      designed precisely for demonstrating that humans and geese could coexist peacefully. The geese
      could even be pets. This world was possible. People milled about the mansion and the birds
      were largely unaware of them.    Bernie and Montano left the mansion less
      than impressed. A house to foster human-bird relations? Who would design such a thing?    “I bet that guy really got his ass-handed to him when nobody cared,” stated
      Bernie</p>
