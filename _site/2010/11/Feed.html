        <p>(watching a movie)    Svanhild: So, did the puppy
      die?    The Man in Glasses: No. See, look, he’s coming back.    The sleeping bag flowing behind him like a cape, the puppy dashed back
      through the forest. He came upon the clearing where several small boys sat crying. Dutifully,
      he pushed one on top of the sleeping bag, put himself back in the harness, and began another
      run into the forest.    Bloodied human limbs were scattered everywhere and
      bits of flesh hung crudely from branches. The turkeys wandered around casually taking bites of
      the meat at will. But the main attraction was the current victim, another small boy, just
      barely alive, but still with fresh meat on him-the kind the turkeys liked best. They flocked
      around him, pecking at his mangled body.    The puppy arrived and
      immediately pushed the boy he had brought next to another one. “Please don’t do this!” pleaded
      the child, but to no one in particular. The turkeys could not understand him and he knew that
      after the other child was taken, he would be next. There was no hope for him, and so he ducked
      his head into his arms and cried quietly amongst the feeding.</p>
