        <p>The blue moonlight spilled in through the windows of the study, painting
      the mahogany shelves and ancient books with its hollow sheen. Yet despite its radiance, the
      tall bookcases disallowed for any of this welcome light to procure more than a small allowance
      of the room, leaving much of the library still shrouded in utter darkness…    A sense of fear grew inside the lady as she cautiously moved through the shadowed room.
      Cognizant of being watched, she turned around to find the withered face of the master of the
      house peering back at her as he sat at the large oak table. His visage a strange glowing ember
      protruding forth from the obsidious wall enveloping him, she began her way back to the
      opposite end of the room from whence she came so as to speak with him.    With a drop in her chest came the certainty of a malevolent presence in the room, and she
      turned to find the master collapsed on the table, his face in his arms. Alarmed, she ran to
      him and began shaking his body to awake him from what she hoped was only slumber, only to
      watch in horror as the body fell limply from the table.    …and she
      turned to find the master face down on the table. Alarmed, she ran to him and began to shake
      his body to awake him from what she hoped was only slumber. The body fell backwards into the
      chair, and the master’s eyes stared ahead, fixed with the poisonous color of Charon’s waters.
      Dead, yes, but his mouth still spoke in a silent language of things monstrous and profane.
      Horrified, the lady opened her mouth to scream, but so great was her terror that no sound
      would dare emerge!</p>
