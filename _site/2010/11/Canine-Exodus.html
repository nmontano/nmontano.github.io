        <p>From the many neighborhoods, thousands of dogs coalesced onto a single
      path.    “Where are they going?”    “It’s Oskar,”
      answered Montano. “He’s leading them.”    And so he ran into the great
      mass of dogs to find Oskar, and where he was heading.    The path the dogs
      tread concluded in a small garden. Amazed by its beauty, Montano wandered the paths weaving
      through it, as did the dogs and some other humans. Six peacocks meandered around, displaying
      their magnificent tails.    A younger girl traveling in the opposite
      direction of Montano handed him some flowers.    “For-for me?” he asked,
      admiring the gift. “I can’t thank you enough-“ his voice choked up due to a hiccup attack he
      was about to have.    “Yeah, its fine, just take them,” said the girl
      quickly, thinking he was about get emotional.    He wandered around the
      garden some more. A dog approached him and spoke into his mind:    “You
      will pick up my shit later.”</p>
