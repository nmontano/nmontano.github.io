        <p>Nebraska. The door to the house party opened, revealing a shaggy haired
      youth.    “I brought a spinach pizza,” said Montano, holding up the
      frozen, green pie.    “Come on in,” said the boy.    The two exchanged pleasantries, after which, to his chagrin, Montano observed that
      several pizzas had already been brought. Setting his down with the others, he then began
      descending an enormously steep staircase. Jack was standing against a wall on the
      landing.    “Hey!” cried the shaggy haired boy. “So where do you
      work?”    “I work…I work at…hmm…I…work…” his memory failing, he
      turned to Jack who was shaking his head in disbelief and shame at Montano’s inability to
      remember. “Dude,” whispered Montano,”where do I work?” Quietly, Jack gave him the
      answer.    “Ah!” Montano exclaimed. “I work at Cluven Larenth.”    Later, as the last rays of light were disappearing beneath the horizon,
      Montano found himself kneeling in front of a grave, the house party raging in the distance.
      Reverently, he placed a plastic sign over the freshly dug earth.      Thank you, God  , he thought.   Thank you for…wait…which dog is buried here?…thank you
      for…is it even a dog?…uh…thank you for whoever is buried here.</p>
