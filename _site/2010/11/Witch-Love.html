        <p>In the sanctuary, Nee approached Montano holding one of her paintings. It
      was a landscape of a forest, and beneath one of the trees was a sleeping man. His beautiful
      lover watched him, circled the tree, and when she reappeared became an ugly old witch holding
      some stale bagels.    Montano was in love with the witch but did not know
      she was one. Upon one trip to the witch’s house, he played a game of chase with three cats,
      alternately beautiful women. Upon sneaking up on the cats, he scared them and they scattered
      about the room. Quickly, he spanked one of the beautiful girls, and she turned to him with a
      excited look of surprise: “Naughty!”    It seemed as though everyone knew
      Montano’s lover was a witch except him. Despite all their attempts to tell him, the witch was
      always succesful in thwarting them and keeping him in darkness.    In a
      forest there was a pumpkin with an extremely detailed face. Seeing Montano approach alone, it
      knew that now was its chance. “You certainly wouldn’t want to turn off your radio now,” it
      said, its eyes shifting back and forth, “especially because I’m about to tell you that your
      girlfriend is a witch!”    Briefly Frank, Montano left his apartment in
      the strip mall to approach the witch. He had discovered the stale bagels.    “You lied to me,” he said.    “What about?”    “You’re a witch.”    “Nonsense.”    “You can’t
      fool me any more. Get out!” He began to make the sign of the cross over her. “In the name of
      the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I order you to leave!”    Unfazed, she again tried to reason with him. “But I love you!”    “Get out.”    “You can’t prove anything.”    “Get
      out.”    “Give me a chance.”    “Get out.”    The witch shed her disguise, revealing her true form-a stocky real estate
      agent.    “Fine. I don’t need you,” he said.    “Get
      out.”    “I don’t like your apartment anyway.”    “Get
      out.”    “I wouldn’t want to live here anymore anyway. The trees are
      withering.”    “Get out.”    “I never even liked
      you.”    “Get out.”    “I’m going now.”    “Get out.”    “Goodbye forever.”    “Get out.”</p>
