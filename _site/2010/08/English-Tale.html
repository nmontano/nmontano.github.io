        <p>from   The Last Fall                by C. Slewis    “Nestled deep in a forest we find a young lad named
      Jim, who, kneeling in front of a tree stump, was busily carving a set of dinnerware out of the
      brittle wood for use in the evening meal. His parents lay sick in bed, too enfeebled to do
      anything on their own, and it was up to Jim to keep the household running smoothly. But if
      there was one thing he wanted more than anything, it was that special Arizona salt selenium.
      Only such a spice could cure his parents of their ailments.    In vain did
      young Jim search for the selenium, for its price was far outside of his impoverished savings.
      He even offered up the services of his body to a fair damsel in the village for recompense,
      but the end result of this endeavor was a bludgeon to his foot, earning him the moniker of
      ‘Star-toed Jim.’                         If
      the pain alone hadn’t been enough     for
      poor Jim, this new shameful deformity disallowed him to find any substantial work, for nobody
      wished to be seen with such a cripple.    Once, poor Jim, thinking he had
      found selenium, consumed an incredible amount of what was in fact turmeric. An unforeseen
      outcome of this was the embarrassing enlargement of the hole of his arse to a monstrous
      circumference. And if you were to ask Jim what it was like to have such an immense orifice
      down there, he would right tell you that ‘It be best to turn me over and see for yourself if
      there be a person walking around inside there, for it is always better to experience something
      for yourself than have it be described for you.’ “</p>
