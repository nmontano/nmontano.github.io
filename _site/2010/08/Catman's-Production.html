        <p>He pointed the gun at the door, where, just as he expected, the figure of
      his adversary burst in.    “Don’t you fucking move, Banquo,” spoke Macbeth
      from his bed. “The game is over.” A laser target appeared on Banquo’s forehead.    “Clever bastard. But they all know what you’ve done. Killing me will only
      prove your guilt.” He slowly approached.    “Will it?” Macbeth struggled
      to remember his next line. “Or perhaps if they caught you now, they’d see a different story.
      Just like-“ At that Banquo used the Force to pry the gun from Macbeth’s hand. With amazing
      reflex, Macbeth lunged on him before he could fire the weapon.    The door
      flew open as they were fighting on the floor. Macbeth landed a blow on Banquo’s head, knocking
      him out.    “What is going on here!?” exclaimed a damsel.    “Nothing! We’re trying to protect you from the killer. FOR CHRISSAKES GET OUT
      OF HERE!” cried Macbeth. Fearful, she ran away, muttering something about ‘strong
      language.’    Banquo was still on the floor, writhing in pain, which gave
      Macbeth a minute to breath. Impulsively, he pulled out a small photo of three Muslim women
      wearing rainbow colored burkas. From small slits their eyes bore into his soul, and Macbeth
      screamed in agony.</p>
