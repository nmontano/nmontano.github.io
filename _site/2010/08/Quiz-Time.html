        <p>The high school students quickly filed into the classroom as Hansona
      shuffled some notes in an attempt to look busier than she was. Finally, when all the students
      were seated, she began the lecture:    “Ok, so since we’ve all done the
      reading for today, I have one question for you. So according to the movies we all think it is
      Boba Fett who delivered Han Solo to Jabba the Hutt, but after doing the reading, who was it
      really?”    Silence permeated the classroom. After a few seconds, Hansona
      instinctively placed herself in front of a student, and looking down at them with her hands
      open in a giving gesture said:    “Ok, this one’s for you.”    “Uhh…Dengar?”    “NO!” shouted Hansona. “You think it’s
      Dengar?! WOW!”    A brave student raised his hand:    “Was it IG-88?”    “OF COURSE IT’S IG-88!!”</p>
