        <p>Through the night breeze Montano recognized the mellifluous tones of
      Ghandel’s “Air” emanating from the coach bus in the distance. He dropped the book he was
      marking and dashed towards it for he wanted to play that song.    But as
      he approached, his heart sank. The bus was already full. There were too many musicians and he
      didn’t even have his instrument anyway. Jack and Moptop stood staring at him in his misery,
      the rain gently falling now.    “You could always try Petrarch’s bus,” one
      commented.    “Of course!”    After he had gathered
      his instrument from his house, and after a frustrating ordeal opening garages and half garages
      (“Who puts a fence behind a garage door?!”), Montano dashed to where Petrarch’s bus was
      parked, only to find that it had left without him. His heart sank again. The deck coffee shop
      located above where the bus had been was cleaning up for the night, and Montano called to one
      of the employees.    “Hey! So the bus left, right?”    “Yeah,” replied an attractive girl. The moon shined quietly in the background.    “Dang it!”    “Were you supposed to be on it?”    “Yes.”    “Awwwww,” she tossed him a figurine to make him
      feel better.    “Hey, well do you want to go for a walk later?”    “No!” Offended, she quickly turned around and left.    “Oh c’mon, I’ve had a rough night!” He looked down at the beaded action figure. It was a
      catman.</p>
