        <p>Montano sat on the floor before the counter, thinking he was in line. The
      colossal coffee shop was packed tonight, each of its ten stories brimming with the young and
      hip. He had entered the top floor from the peak of a mountain, but quickly found out that the
      top two floors were closed. After climbing down to some inhabited areas, he noticed the
      television monitors flashing with images of clothed teenagers instantly becoming nude and
      running off. “Ah, yes. The familiar old prank,” he thought. It was a rite of passage to become
      instantly nude in front of the cameras here.    Another guy called from
      across the room to where Montano was sitting ‘in line.’    “Hey man you
      having a good time?”    “Yeah.” He lied.    “I love
      how during each commercial break that one game show guy just goes up and stands there!”    “Yeah.” He was talking about a man who would appear and stare grimly at the
      tables, but Montano didn’t find it that funny.    “Hey, are you just
      waiting to get water?”    “Yeah.”    “Dude, that’s
      over there! This is the coffee line!”    Montano, puzzled, looked over to
      a small curtained booth, where, sure enough, there were people filling cups with water. He
      nodded to the man in thanks and headed over. The overhead monitor flashed on and the recorded
      footage of his own instant-nuding appeared on the screen. Unmoved by the memory, he positioned
      the cup under the spigot and turned back to the monitor as it filled. Now it showed Dingland
      embracing a very nervous man under a blanket. “That’s not a prank,” he thought, an uneasy look
      growing on his face.    He looked down at his cup and took a sip.
      Realizing it was white wine and not water, he poured it back up the spigot, and making sure
      nobody had seen his blunder, left the booth quickly.</p>
