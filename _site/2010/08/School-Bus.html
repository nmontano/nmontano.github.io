        <p>Montano stepped into the humid school bus and plopped down behind the empty
      driver’s seat. Thirsty, he pulled out a water pitcher and began pouring it into his palm. His
      hand filled up like a glass until Chatterly, seated behind him, noticed this trick.    “Whoa! Can I have some water?” she asked.    “Um, well,
      uh-“ The water started to spill off his hand.    “You’re going to need a
      glass,” stated Veen, who had just stepped on the bus. She smirked at his incompetence.    Montano started at the tiny pool of water in his cupped hand. It was filled
      with sand and sediment.    The bus lurched forward despite the driver’s
      absence.    “Where is the driver?” asked Montano, turning to
      Chatterly.    “On another bus.”</p>
