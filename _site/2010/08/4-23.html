        <p>Terror gripped Montano to a degree he had never experienced. It was the
      deep of an eternal night, and he was being hunted-he and The One Who Left. He had barely
      managed to get her back on his leash before they ran around the pond, though she had almost
      slipped back out of it in their terrified flight. The Horrific One was after him again, and it
      was necessary that they get to the house to shut the garages.    A
      malevolent presence filled the air, penetrating the thick forests and the abandoned
      neighborhood and infecting every last crevice with a monstrous, invisible stain. The glimmer
      of the moon on the earth did nothing to alleviate this hideous stress; rather, its pale light
      pressed down on the trees and land, suffocating them with a silent, infernal song.    Montano was alone on the driveway. The large garage had been closed, but with
      the small one he had failed. Despair filled him. All was lost. He would have to run forever.
      As he gathered his strength, the whirr of an electric wheelchair signaled the approach of The
      Tragedian down the driveway. Above a thickly bearded face, his penetrating eyes peered through
      their round frames at Montano standing pathetically in the moonlight. He had nothing to
      say.</p>
