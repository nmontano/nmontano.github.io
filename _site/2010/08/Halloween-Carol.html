        <p>A cold wind blew through the damp streets. The final shafts of sunlight
      were now almost extinguished, and the street lights were beginning to turn on. All was silent
      save for a violent pounding coming from outside a particular house.    An
      angry fist rained down on the door in rhythmic bursts, accompanied by the angry calling
      of:    “Bob Cratchit! Bob Cratchit!”    The knocks
      continued until finally after some time, the door was opened by three persons:    “What do you want?” asked Cajun Mother.    “Is Bob
      Cratchit here?” demanded Montano, coldly.    “Yes,” she said while
      stepping away, and revealing her son, Moptop.    “Do you know that today
      is Christmas?” Montano asked in a stern voice.    “It is not,” he replied
      boldly.    Montano’s charade quickly faded:    “Of
      course it isn’t! It’s Halloween! Prepare the treats!” Cajun Mother removed herself to the
      kitchen to set the desserts.    “She’s very good at what she does,” noted
      Moptop.    “Oh-I know.” Montano smiled briefly before an intense mood
      swing. With an abrupt gesture, he turned to Nole, grabbed him by the collar and in an angry,
      yet subdued voice said: “If I had my way, I would bake everyone with his own turkey.”    Moptop and Montano entered the kitchen where thousands of delicious treats
      awaited them on the table, though Cajun Mother seemed to have absented herself. They began
      snacking only to be interrupted by Nole, who entered, and in a extremely high voice,
      began:    “Eeee mogo laffaw shoobee trando reego vurto trivvyshma lassa
      moto-“    “Stop that,” ordered Moptop.</p>
