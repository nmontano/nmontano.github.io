        <p>A full moon shined down on Montano as he entered the small mall. Knowing he
      had a few minutes to spare before the musical started, he decided to relieve himself and
      entered the bathroom.    Montano stared in the mirror at his morphed face.
      How long had it been like that? He didnâ€™t know, but as he continued to stare he recognized
      that whoever it was had done an incredible job of painting a Pulcinella mask onto his face. He
      even had the characteristic long nose, molded intricately out of thick globs of paint. He
      grabbed some paper towels and began wiping furiously, the paint coming off steadily in large
      chunks.    Montano stared in amazement. Underneath the mask his face been
      painted with the mien of another-Pierrot. How was that even possible? he wondered. He grabbed
      some more paper towels and began to wash it from his skin, but it was stubborn. After several
      minutes of frantic scrubbing, he only succeeded in removing the pale white make-up from one
      side of his face.    Montano gave up. Now a sad clown, he sighed and
      returned to the mall.</p>
