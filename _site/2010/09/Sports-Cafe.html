        <p>The extremely dim sports cafe was having a slow afternoon. Some golf
      tournament was playing on the TVs in the background but nobody was paying much attention to
      it.    On the front cash register had been taped a picture of a fudgsicle,
      which one customer noticed with excitement:    “Hey! This looks like an
      ice cream place!”    The head waiter approached him, irate.    “What did you say?”    “Uh, that this looks like an ice
      cream place.”    “Yeah. That’s what I thought you said. Well, let’s see
      how you feel about that after   this  .”    A monster appeared wielding a chainsaw
      and flicked it on as he raised it high over his head. The customer screamed, as did a row of
      young children who were standing in front of him. The monster let the chainsaw fall onto the
      man, cutting through his flesh in quick strokes and making short work of him. The monster
      turned his attention to the children, and with ease sliced through them like a knife through
      butter.    Time passed. A new customer entered the sports cafe and after
      giving a look around, noticed the picture of the fudgsicle on the register. He couldn’t have
      known that his next observation would be his last:    “Hey! This looks
      kind of like an ice cream place!”</p>
