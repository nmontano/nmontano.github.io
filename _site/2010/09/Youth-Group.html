        <p>Montano flushed the sink and prepared himself to enter the fray. He hated
      bible study youth groups and wasn’t even a member of the one now meeting in his grandparent’s
      house. He had fallen into a trap.    He quietly entered the living room
      where everyone was gathered around a man he assumed to be the leader.    “Alright now let’s have a prayer by Mr. Zapple.” Everyone bowed their heads but when
      Montano did, a thunderous squeak emerged from his neck.    “Don’t worry
      about it, I squeak all the time!” reassured an uncomfortably friendly teenager.    The prayer went on, and a man with a buzz cut came and sat down next to
      Montano. He waved enthusiastically at him, and Montano observed that he looked a lot like
      Jelnikia.    Later, when the man handed the menu to Montano, he made an
      amazing realization.    “Are you Jelnikia?”    “Yeah!”    “You got a…haircut.”    She laughed
      nervously.</p>
