        <p>Grease-stained plates covered the table, accompanied by staling pieces of
      mediocre pizza while fluorescent lights rained down harshly on the dining establishment. Dross
      entered in a fur coat.    “Looks like Oscar is going to be…  going away for a while  .” A big grin danced across
      his face. From the table Jambor looked up at him disinterestedly.    “Oh
      come on. Yes, he’s a putz but it isn’t all bad. He’s still got some good stuff going for him.
      Give him another shot.”    “Oh no. Not this time. Oscar has no more
      blunders to make. He’s   outta here.  “    “What about those exugomic things?”    Dross hadn’t
      considered this. “Hmm. He   could   sell
      those chairs…all he’d have to do is be real sassy to the queers and they’d buy it! They
      fucking love those chairs!”    In a light-filled tunnel between two
      dimensions, a figure struggled to put on a pair of underwear.    “Have you
      listened to ‘Angel’?” asked Narin to the figure.    “Isn’t that that dumb
      New Age crap?” he replied, annoyed.    Finally, he succeeded in his
      endeavor and looked up at Narin to find she was Merrem.</p>
