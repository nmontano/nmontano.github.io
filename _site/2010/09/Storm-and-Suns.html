        <p>A young Asian girl was walking through the large field with a tray of
      toiletries. When she got to the wrecked car, Montano stopped her and took a kleenex. He turned
      to blow his nose so that his germs might not be caught in the increasing winds and spread to
      another. When he turned back, the girl was looking out at the storm clouds in the distance in
      terror. Behind her, large pastel colored lungs and flowers were slowly falling from the sky
      many miles away.    “I don’t think I’m going to have that baseball game
      today,” he commented to The Man In Glasses. This was going to be a big storm. As they left the
      field, Montano noticed a rip in the earth where a few beach balls had been stored.    Forward out of the field they traveled backwards and found themselves on a
      marble monolith many miles high in the sky, far above the clouds.    “Look!” said The Man In Glasses. “The goddamn sun is already setting!” Sure enough, the
      sun was sinking beneath the clouds, but above it another sun was setting. The sky was drenched
      in unnatural orange light, and Montano suspected this was much more than a storm.    “Maybe it is just our location,” suggested Gridin, who had arrived.    “No,” stated The Man In Glasses, turning to Montano. “I don’t think you’re
      going to have that baseball game this year.”    “Today, you mean. Not
      ‘this year’.”    “And be sure to get $25 dollars to my dad for the band
      uniforms,” said Jack’s voice as it streaked across the sky.</p>
