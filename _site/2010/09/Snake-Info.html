        <p>Montano had finally scored a reservation at the fancy French place in the
      slums. He had even got the first pick of the gas station he would walk to during the fourth
      course of the meal. He was elated.    “Have you seen the snakes?” asked
      Stella who appeared on the dark street.    “The green ones?”    “Yeah. They’re everywhere.”    “I’ve seen them.” He
      remembered them as being little green coils.    “But its weird because
      most people think snakes have their tails on the ground when they move, but they’re actually
      in the air. In fact, you can only distinguish the head from the tail based on which is
      touching the ground.”    Montano nodded. The snakes had entered the street
      where they stood, their tails high in the air. They reminded him of vacuum cleaners.</p>
