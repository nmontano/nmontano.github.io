        <p>The library was set up much like Kane’s neighborhood- something Montano
      noticed as he searched for the aesthetics book by Archibald Lewis. Each aisle was given a
      street name: Maudette Ave., Laurie St., Borff Dr., etc. But he seemed to recall his book being
      on Kane’s street. Ah, yes: Linwood. He turned onto it and fell into a sports pit. Some
      adolescents were playing a game with a blue ball that he didn’t recognize, but now that he was
      here and didn’t know how to get out, he was expected to play. The ball rolled towards him, and
      summoning his athletic abilities he tossed it to one of the helmeted kids.    “Aww this guy is lame!”    “What?! YOU LITTLE SHITS!” insulted
      Montano. With that, he climbed a ladder out of the sports pit, which had actually been a
      swimming pool.    He wandered deeper into the library and it gradually
      changed into an autumnal landscape. There was a fish festival here that Montano enjoyed, and
      when it was over he climbed a tiny hill and entered Merjo’s house just as it started to
      rain.    “Taco contest!” cried his uncle. Montano and Merrem seated
      themselves at the table while Merpam prepared the tacos and set one down before each of them.
      “1…2…3!” signaled Merjo. Montano took a bite of his but Merrem got up and left. Montano
      set down his taco and began conversing with his relatives. Eventually, the topic turned to
      dogs.    “We had a dog once,” reminisced Merpam. “I loved him but then he
      died.”    “How did he die?” inquired Montano, who had stood up to make a
      quesadilla.    “We were doing laundry and accidentally put him in the
      dryer-“    “WHAT! WHOA! HAHAHA! THAT’S RIDICULOUS! THE DRYER! HO HO! THAT
      WAS DUMB!” Montano continued to scoop out of an empty bowl of cheese in the midst of his
      insults. “I CAN’T BELIEVE THAT! WOW! PATHETIC REALLY!”    Merpam exploded
      with rage. “GET OUT! GET OUT OF HERE! HOW DARE YOU INSULT ME IN MY HOME! GET OUT!”    Montano walked upstairs and joined Mercourt and Merrem in looking out the
      window. The rain had picked up significantly, such to the point that the entire house was
      surrounded by raging currents, and it was clear that they would all be taken away by it
      shortly.</p>
