        <p>Night in the forest. The contest began and everyone ran quickly to get
      their hands on one of the special sticks. Montano arrived at one simultaneously with a bald
      adversary.    “Give it up, boy!” demanded the bald man as they both
      grabbed it.    “Let go, fool!” Montano replied. “The stick is mine!”    Montano won but he knew that he would probably need to go to Persia for his
      next stick, and a map of the region loomed in his mind.    Meanwhile,
      Wolfadeus Mosart and a busty lady had absented themselves from the ball and stolen away to a
      bedroom (it was Montano’s). Wolfadeus set the lady down on the bed and their lips joined
      together, the passion growing until the composer pulled away briefly. “Maybe make a little
      cattleya? Hmm?” The lady giggled and they resumed their task, Wolfadeus’ hand now exploring
      the lady’s ample chest. As the passion increased, everything followed as would be expected in
      the steps of carnal pleasure, but deep inside Wolfadeus swirled troubling waters. He knew he
      couldn’t perform.</p>
