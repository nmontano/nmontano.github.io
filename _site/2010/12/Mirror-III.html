        <p>The police officer entered the apartment building. Upon locating the
      landlord in the front office, he motioned to him to follow: “C’mon. You’re going to want to
      see this.”    The police officer, now an old man, threw open the door of
      the apartment to discover a small crowd watching a copy of himself make out with an unknown
      person underneath him.    “Alright, knock it off. Get up,” he said. The
      copy complied, revealing that another copy was underneath him. “You,” he pointed at the second
      copy. “Out.”    The second copy became Pinky and left the room.    The old man and the copy, both now Brain, stared at each other.    “You sick fuck,” said Brain.    “What! It isn’t a big
      deal!” replied the Brain copy.    “He’s part of the family!”    “No! He doesn’t even have our last name!”    “You make me
      sick…”</p>
