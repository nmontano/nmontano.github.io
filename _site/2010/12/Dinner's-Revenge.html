        <p>Gripped firmly in hand by several students, Montano looked ahead to the
      enormous fry pans at the opposite end of the gymnasium and knew he was going to be eaten. The
      room was crowded and filled with many tables featuring bottles of artisan beers, but as he was
      swiftly dragged past them Montano had no time to examine them. French toast was on the menu,
      and so was he.    Brought before the frying pans, the kids vigorously
      shoved him under the table holding them up.   Did they
      mess up? Are they storing me down here?   A hefty black man came around and lit the
      burners only inches away from Montano, but did not notice him.    After a
      time, he gained the courage to venture back into the gym, thinking the students had forgotten
      to eat him. He paused briefly to look at one of the beers, but did not desire it and moved on.
      Catching sight of one of the traitorous students who wanted him dead, he quickly approached
      her as she stood in her wire cube.    “So!” he began cockily as he grabbed
      her leg, “You think you can eat the teacher!” He pulled the leg higher and began punching her
      in the gut. From behind came another student who began feeling her up. “MELVYN!” exclaimed
      Montano. Yet another betrayer.   But he might
      remember…   Montano quickly took his leave and kept moving through the gym.    Though he knew he had to keep a low profile (Melvyn was trailing him), the
      sight of the betrayer Thierry filled him with rage. Flinging him around, Montano grabbed his
      face and began stretching it.    “AH! Friedrich!” cried Thierry. “You
      can’t do this!” More hands joined Montano in grotesquely stretching out his face. “Fried!
      FRIED!”</p>
