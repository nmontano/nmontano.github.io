        <p>Montano remembered…    The tornado was descending
      rapidly upon the prairie.    “No!” cried Montano. “I don’t want it to find
      me!” So he hid himself behind a tree.    The tornado moved closer.    “No!” cried Montano. “I don’t want it to find me!” So he ducked behind a
      car.    The tornado continued onward.    “No!” cried
      Montano. “I don’t want it to find me!” So he jumped in a barrel, but the high winds quickly
      took it away, and he desperately held on to a hand rail in the earth  and he
      desperately clutched on to the grass, hoping it could resist the winds.    The tornado was close now.    “No!” cried Montano. “I don’t want it
      to find me!” So he crawled under a nearby bed. With great relief did he watch from beneath as
      the tornado stormed past without discovering him.    But no sooner had it
      gone than Montano watched as the wheels of a covered wagon approached from down the road. When
      it parked right before the bed, he assumed it was one of the tornado’s henchmen and quickly
      began to shuffle backwards out from under the bed.    “Hey!” said the
      sheriff as he ducked his head under the bed. “Come on out of there!” Montano tried to shoot
      him with his hand, but no luck. The sheriff came after him.    Nestled
      between the sheriff and the fat deputy, Montano stared ahead blankly as the wagon traveled
      down the road.    “Good thing we found you!” said the sheriff. “The last
      thing you want to do is be a zombie!”    As he continued talking, Montano
      took a large misshapen gun and shot himself in the face. His blood spilled over the sheriff
      and deputy, who instinctively began to take their shoes off lest the virus spread. But it was
      far too late.    Montano awoke, changed. With a quick grab he plunged his
      hand into the belly of the deputy and shoved the flesh into his mouth. The sheriff continued
      talking but as he turned to look at Montano, he stopped and then licked the blood from
      Montano’s face.    The three zombies drove on.</p>
