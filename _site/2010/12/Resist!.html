        <p>His foot anchored against the wall behind him for support, Montano pressed
      his body against the basement door, waiting for the blow. When it came, the full force of Mr.
      Couches weight against the door flung Montano back, and he found himself frantically
      struggling to regain lost ground.     The
      bathtub was immense, and it was going to be a difficult struggle to keep it contained.
         How many foot-joules of energy am I
      using?   he wondered as he pushed against the door.    When he
      finally succeeded in shutting it, he took out his plastic purple sword and began swiping it
      underneath the door to attack Mr. Couches. “Effing fool!” Swipe. “GET BACK!” Swipe. He pushed
      the sword entirely under the door in an attempt to stab his porcelaneous adversary.    Finally he managed to lock the basement door, but it was an old lock and he
      wasn’t convinced that it would hold. Montano desperately wanted to see the monkeys, but he
      couldn’t let Mr. Couches get out. He couldn’t.    On a computer, the cops
      called each other. “Are we ready to see them? Are we ready to go?” “No, Little Canada will be
      late.”    Montano looked at the flash animation- dozens of monkeys and one
      black man sat in a row and furiously poked each other.    Montano
      smiled.</p>
