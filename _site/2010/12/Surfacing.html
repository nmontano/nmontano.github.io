        <p>“Because if you think you have a poof on your upper lip, you don’t,”
      remarked Montano as he observed her pink lipstick with a sort of strange ecstasy.    “Hah. Whatever. I totally do.” Despite her rebuttal, he could tell she was
      clearly flattered by his statement.    She got out the car and Montano and
      his mom watched as she walked up the driveway to her house before driving off.    “So, the dog was a substitute teacher? The One Who Left? Did she explain how
      she did it? How she got the kids to be quiet? Does she have any tips?” asked Montano    “No, but you know it’s her DAD who is the one flirting with all of her
      friends-“ said his mom.    “Yeah, but the dog! How did the dog do
      it!?”    They began pulling into their driveway. “Well, my friend Linda
      would always say when she saw a dog: ‘Oh, isn’t he well-behaved’ but sort of tongue in cheek
      and worried with her teeth clenched because she was terrified of dogs…”    Montano stared ahead at his garage. Never going to know. Wrong side. Small door on wrong
      side. NOW I WON’T EVER KNOW. TWO. TOW. Circuitous. Like the book. Going back. To the
      garage   four old men wander down the streets bringing us back to Howth Castle and
      Environs-</p>
