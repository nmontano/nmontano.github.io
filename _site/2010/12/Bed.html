        <p>Through a door in the ventilation shaft no larger than his eye, Montano
      watched as Lavick recounted how she first met him to a group of bubbly girls in the
      gymnasium.    “Dude,” she addressed Montano when she had finished, “we can
      totally see you up there.”    Montano came down into a dark room and found
      Ghala in his bed with Rasilo.    “Get out. My turn,” he commanded.    As she grudgingly got out of the bed, Montano noticed that she had put her
      clothes in his dirty clothes basket. As he dug through it he also found a pair of Rasilo’s
      glowing neon underwear.   Everyone puts their clothes in
      my dirty clothes basket,   he observed. Finding the evaluation sheet next to him he
      gave it a quick once-over.    “This isn’t a very good superhero…” he
      noticed.    “Hmmm. No,” said Rasilo, leaning back into bed. “Not
      really.”    Montano disrobed and climbed in, pulling the blanket up over
      them both. As he sank into his pillow, he felt the weight of Rasilo’s head as it came to rest
      on his chest. Montano draped an arm around his friend, drew him in closer, and he was
      happy.</p>
