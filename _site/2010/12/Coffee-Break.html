        <p>The musical cue alerting him, Montano dashed back into the living room
      where Merjo, Merrem and Mermat sat facing him. He immediately began his choregraphed dance to
      the cop song-moonwalking here, running in place there, and bending on his knees to show his
      audience the police badge which was written on a fortune cookie paper. The song ended and the
      three viewers clapped politely.    After changing, Montano decided it was
      time for some coffee, and so his mind left the living room and went onto the street, now in
      Merjo’s (but almost Malvo’s) jeep. He followed the meandering roads out of the forest, finally
      reaching his destination. He entered the cafe and looked at the trivia behind the counter to
      see if he knew the answer (“Who cared that Ener-Eggs and Big Eggs were similar?”) As he waited
      in line, he shoved his hand into his pocket to see what money he had.    There was no pocket, only skin. The spark of realization hit him.   My belt.   His hand slowly moved up the side of his
      leg to find it.   No belt.   He
      understood.    He desperately pulled his shirt down in a vain attempt to
      cover his privates. To no success, his shirt was not long enough to cover anything. And so
      panicked, he ran out of the coffee shop and back to the jeep, screeching out of the parking
      lot and narrowly avoiding hitting another car on his way back into the forest.</p>
