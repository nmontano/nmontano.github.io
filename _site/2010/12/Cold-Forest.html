        <p>The forest was dark and damp, blanketed by a thick layer of heavy clouds.
      Beneath them, the dying leaves glowed brilliantly along the meandering paths.    Montano took a left, a right, and walked through a tunnel of crimson leaves.
      They mesmerized him but as he took one in hand its color faded slightly.    Exiting the tunnel, he continued on and noticed a horse and its foal entering the dirty
      lake. He figured they were attempting to tread it, but as their heads sunk under the water
      their fate became clear.    Exiting the tunnel, he continued on and
      noticed a unicorn and its foal entering the dirty lake. They only waded a little bit before
      turning around and heading to land. Montano watched cautiously from behind a tree as they
      slowly approached him. He was a little frightened of the creature at first, being unsure of
      its temperament.   It could impale me,   he
      thought. The adult came up next to him and he found he was no longer afraid. With a gentle
      hand, he began to clean the lake grime away from the majestic beast as a cold breeze howled
      past.</p>
