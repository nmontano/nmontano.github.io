        <p>“The two men and bikini-clad girl made their way through the cavernous
      house, their candelabra illuminating the red carpet and mahogony walls. There was something
      evil in this place, and it could strike at any moment.    ‘Oh no! It’s
      everywhere!’ screamed the girl. A thousand girls in bikinis came out of nowhere and attacked
      the trio.”    Montano got up, left the movie theater, got into his car and
      drove off. He was glad to get out of that movie, as he was sure he had seen it before. The
      world had a sort of staged, cartoonish look today, but that didn’t bother him much. He
      continued driving until he came across a large silver behemoth with a long beard on the side
      of the road. He began to slow his vehicle to get a better look at this malevolent giant, but
      before he could do much, it came to life and started swiping at his vehicle. Montano stepped
      on the gas. Unfortunately, the giant got on his silver motorcycle and began to give chase.
      Montano’s tiny car was no match for the brute speed of his adversary, who he assumed was
      chasing him only to eat him upon capture. The giant landed a blow on the back of his car with
      his large fist, causing Montano to fall out of his seat though fortunately still managing to
      hold onto the steering wheel. The giant’s attacks were frequent now, his large hands slowly
      but surely demolishing Montano’s only method of escape. A hand grabbed Montano’s leg and he
      screamed and began frantically kicking the giant’s face with his free foot, each attack only
      incensing the giant further. Was this the end?    “The eyes of the
      bikini-clad girl looked into those of a handsome young man as they stood over the kitchen
      counter.    ‘I love you,’ she said.  ‘I love you, too, but we
      have to get out of here,’ he explained.”    Montano slumped into his chair
      in the theater. “Not   this   movie
      again…”</p>
