        <p>Montano sat back in the comfortable arm chair. It had been a long road to
      get to this point, and he needed a break. Across from him in the living room was the door to
      the basement, where his colleague, Chatterly, had finally cornered the deceitful Saul. It
      would only be a matter of time before she would emerge with a completely exorcised Saul, one
      rid of the desire to serve The Dark Adversary.    Every now and then
      Montano could hear fragments of words being tossed around between Chatterly and Saul, but he
      could not piece them together coherently. Montano grew uneasy. Something was not right. Why
      was this taking so long?    The basement door opened, and Saul and
      Chatterly emerged with a third person, a blond-haired woman who Montano did not recognize, all
      of them grinning.    “Montano, everything is fine. I’ve been talking with
      Saul and he is right. We have no choice but to serve The Dark One,” said Chatterly in a
      soothing and clear-headed voice.  “Yeah, it’s true, just join our side. You don’t
      want to face the consequences anyway, right?!” said Saul, a goofy smile plastered on his
      face.    Rage grew within Montano as he looked at the malevolent trio. It
      had been a trap! Chatterly had never been his partner! They had planned this from the start!
      Montano’s thoughts raced. He would have to act fast if he wanted to get out of here
      alive.    “C’mon. You know what will happen if you don’t join us. Don’t be
      a fool,” said Chatterly as she approached Montano. “I switched to the other side. You should,
      too!” Montano stood up from his chair, and with a brisk motion punched Chatterly in the face,
      knocking her out instantly.    “Whoa! Haha!” laughed Saul. “You really
      knocked her out there! Awesome!” Montano turned to him and pulled an extremely sharp blue pen
      from his pocket. It was time to act!    With a quick jab, he thrust the
      pen into Saul’s arm, withdrawing it to reveal only a small trickle of blood. He stabbed again,
      this time in his chest. Why wasn’t he dying? thought Montano. He continued stabbing Saul, who
      looked on in curious interest. After what must have been twelve pen wounds, Montano stepped
      back. Saul did not appear fazed at all, and he began to laugh at the pitiful attempt to
      destroy him. The blond-woman, who had been watching the entire ordeal from the start, started
      laughing as well. And then Montano knew who she was-The Dark Adversary had been released from
      the basement. With malicious grins on their faces, they slowly stepped towards
      Montano.</p>
