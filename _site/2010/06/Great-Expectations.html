        <p>Dread filled Montano as he entered his bedroom to find his cousin, Mermat,
      climbing into his own bed. However, Montano knew he had to treat the situation gracefully, for
      he was the host:    “OH! Uh, sure you can sleep in my bed but you just
      have to be really careful because I don’t want anybody to get their feet on my pillows. Just,
      just lay there on top of the sheets. Yes. Don’t get under them-just on top. And no feet on the
      pillows.”    In direct violation of Montano’s wishes, Mermat put his feet
      directly on top of the pillows. Montano grabbed his hair in frustration, but his problems were
      just beginning. His younger cousin, Johoff, was now going through his books and knocking them
      off the shelf. Enraged, Montano forcefully pushed him down so as to stop him from further
      disorganizing his collection. Johoff began to cry. Montano panicked. This always happened! Why
      was he always making children cry? It would only be a matter of seconds before Johoff would
      run to his mom and explain what had happened. Montano needed to act quickly.    “Hey, don’t cry! You can read any of the books. Just go ahead and take them!” he said in
      a frantic effort to remedy the situation. Johoff began choosing some large books from the
      shelf, ones unsuitable for children. Montano laughed. “Oh! Ha! No, you’ll never be able to
      read those! You’re just a kid!” This made Johoff cry even more.    Montano
      looked over to his bed where his other cousin, Merrem, had attempted to redo the sheets and
      pillows after her brother Mermat’s rude intrusion there. Despite this kind gesture, Montano
      only grew more incensed.    “No, no, no. All wrong! What are   these   pillows doing on here? These aren’t ever on
      my bed,” he explained as he began throwing them on the floor. “And the sheets are all wrong,
      too! The sides have to be a certain length. Perfectly even. It’s very important that they are
      even!!”    Merrem’s phone rang with a strange disco song, and the voice of
      their grandfather burst out of the small device:    “YO! We want you all
      to come downstairs.”    Montano grabbed the phone. He knew that the fiasco
      in the bedroom would be known to all if they obeyed his wishes. He had to stall!    “Put Nohoff on the phone!” he demanded, but grandfather had already hung up.
      Fortunately, Nohoff, who was Johoff’s brother, was already standing on the arm of Montano’s
      reading chair.    “Hey, you like 19th century fantasy, right?” asked
      Montano. Nohoff’s face did not seem to express any interest in that subject. “What I meant
      was, do you like sci-fi?”  “I guess…I don’t know.”  “Well, read these!”
      Montano handed him some 19th century fantasy novels. “You’ll really like these sci-fi books.”
      Montano prayed Nohoff would not figure out their actual genre.    During
      all of this, Johoff had been stacking more and more books. In a fit of angst, Montano walked
      over and knocked them down, making Johoff cry once more. At a loss as to what to do, Montano
      began to shake him: “STOP CRYING!”    Meanwhile, in a university very far
      away, the renowned English professor, Gerald Bloomberg, walked over to his large office window
      and looked out. It was drizzling, yet the ravens were still out scavenging for food in the
      city square. Inspired by the sight of these animals, the final phrases of the great poem by
      Edward Poeman ran through Bloomberg’s mind:    ‘And that for which we envy
      them most,  is the great economy of their means.’</p>
