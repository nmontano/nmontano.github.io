        <p>Montano entered the dimly lit shack. It was night and the air was thick
      with the scent of human sweat and other bodily secretions. In the back of the space were two
      wire frame beds, on one of which was seated his assigned lover.    “Oh,
      we’re done here. Just give us a moment,” said a young Chinese man sitting before a computer
      immediately in front of Montano, his face illuminated by a blue screen. A smaller Chinese
      woman draped her arms around his neck in what Montano supposed to be a sign of affection. He
      could not see what was on their screen, but both were thoroughly engaged in whatever they were
      looking at.    “How is it going?” asked Montano to his assigned
      lover.  “Oh, you know. Not bad. Should we get started?” he asked.  “Yeah,
      I guess.”  “Wait!” interrupted the Chinese man. “You’re really going to want to get
      tested for STDs first.”  “Oh, how?” inquired Montano.  “We have a device
      that can tell us the likelihood of you being diseased within a matter of seconds,” explained
      the Chinese woman. “Drop your pants.”    Montano obeyed, and the Chinese
      woman attached a large clothespin to his member that had a cord connecting it back to the
      computer. A calculating noise was heard, and the Chinese went back to staring intently at the
      screen.    “So, you’ll want your rating to be in the single digits. That
      means you’re safe,” explained the Chinese man. “Oh, I see you’re at 118.”  “Is that
      really bad?” asked Montano.  “Well, it isn’t good. Let’s try it again.”    The Chinese woman reattached the clothespin as Montano’s assigned lover
      quietly looked on.    “Hmm, now it is even higher. Let’s try one more
      time.” The clothespin was reattached, and Montano, who was only slightly uncomfortable with
      the situation, waited patiently for the next rating.    “Whoa, it is off
      the charts. 2,000!” exclaimed the Chinese man.  “I wouldn’t sleep with him,” said
      the Chinese woman to the assigned lover.    “How could this be?” thought
      Montano. “It must be the AIDS.” He turned to the assigned lover and with a sheepish grin
      shrugged.  “Maybe we should just pass on this for now,” he said.  “Yeah,
      that’s what I’m thinking, too,” concurred the assigned lover.    With a
      sigh of relief Montano pulled up his pants, left the shack, and walked confidently back into
      the refreshing cool of the night.</p>
