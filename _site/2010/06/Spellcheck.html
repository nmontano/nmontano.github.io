        <p>Montano looked out of the window of his skyscraper classroom at the lazily
      moving clouds. It was just another day of school, though the yellow room seemed somewhat
      sparsely populated and the teacher was nowhere to be found. One of his fellow students
      approached him:    “Have you checked the scores yet?” he asked
      Montano.  “What scores? Where?”  “On the outside of the door!”    Montano ran briskly over to the classroom door only to hear some voices
      approaching and some sporadic giggling. Not wanting to be caught out in the hall without the
      teacher’s permission, he decided to wait and listen to who was coming, and pressed his ear
      against the door.    “So as you can see from these scores, I will most
      definitely be playing in the tournament. It is very difficult to score 89 out of 100, but I
      did and it means I will certainly be participating in the chess tournament, and probably
      winning it,” said a smarmy voice to the coos and sighs of adoring women. Montano would
      recognize that voice anywhere. It was his cocky arch-nemesis! Revulsion grew within him at the
      thought of his enemy winning the chess tournament. Suddenly, Montano remembered what the
      scores posted on the door actually were-the spelling test results! Had he earned a high enough
      score to qualify for the tournament?    Montano quickly ran to a computer
      to look up his score. He couldn’t believe his eyes: he had scored 100%! He turned on the
      classroom T.V. to show the other students his unblemished test.    “Look
      everyone! I scored 100!” he exclaimed. With such a high spelling test score, he was sure to
      defeat his adversary at chess with ease.    But then a troublesome thought
      entered Montano’s head: would he be required to play chess   and   spell words at the tournament?</p>
