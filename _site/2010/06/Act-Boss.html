        <p>The flashing lights reflected in the golden mirrors of the small room,
      creating a quasi-psychedelic effect that was rather relaxing. Montano and the beautiful Indian
      woman sat over their dinner of curry, basking in the shifting lights.    “My doctor tells me I need to eat more oatmeal,” she had explained to him earlier.  “I know just the place.”    Here they were, but somehow oatmeal had
      been left out of the equation. Suddenly, an older man in a white suit appeared in the room.
      Montano looked over at his smiling face and knew it was the act boss. However, this was
      nothing to worry about.    The act boss opened his mouth and a swarm of
      bees exploded forth into the room. But before any damage could be done, the curry dish
      attracted the swarm like a magnet, absorbing the insects into its collective savoriness as an
      additional spice. Defeated, the act boss disappeared, and Montano and the Indian woman
      continued their dinner.</p>
