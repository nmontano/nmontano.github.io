        <p>Montano sighed in relief. While the news that they were going to be unable
      to watch the Dogbat’s videos had caused the creature to go into hysterics and plead with
      Montano to reconsider, he had remained firm and told the Dogbat that there simply wasn’t time
      for it. Now, after quite a struggle, he had finally got the Dogbat asleep in its kennel.
      Content though he was with watching the creature sleep peacefully, Montano creeped out of the
      laundry room, shut off the fluorescent lights and quietly shut the door. There was business to
      attend to.    It was late evening and smog filled the city skyline, the
      pale orange glow of the sun behind the cloud creating a repugnant stain on the horizon.
      Montano reached into his back pocket. His wallet was still there, but he would have to be
      vigilant. This was a rough part of the city-the slums. People huddled around trash bin fires,
      and babies could be heard faintly crying from the dilapidated apartment buildings. Some people
      emerged from their plywood shacks to observe Montano as he passed, for he certainly didn’t
      look like one of them. Becoming increasingly uneasy, he thrust his hand into his back pocket
      once more, this time leaving his hand there to ensure his wallet’s safety on his
      journey.    Montano walked through the church’s front door. It was unusual
      to find such a well-kept building amidst the poverty, but not all was well here tonight. As he
      entered the sanctuary, he noticed a steadily growing, and certainly unintentional, fire
      burning near the altar. The pilgrims that populated the room seemed unfazed by this looming
      threat as they continued singing the remaining verses of “Amazing Grace.”    “Ugh,” mumbled Montano. “I   hate   this
      song.” He grabbed a metal bucket resting on the red carpet and approached the fire, hoping to
      put it out somehow. He walked around it, examining it as it grew larger, himself growing more
      desperate for a way to stop it. The Dogbat appeared.    “You just need to
      put the bucket over the fire!” it exclaimed gleefully in its high pitched voice while jumping
      up and down on Montano’s thighs. He decided it was worth a shot and complied. The fire was
      gone.    Night fell. Checking his back pocket for his wallet, Montano
      found himself retracing his steps through the slums, only now turning on a bridge that went
      deeper into the city. There was more work to be done.</p>
