        <p>Montano was huge. Everything around him seemed to be in correct
      proportions, but in his heart he knew he was much larger than was normal. The black beans were
      sizzling away in the electric skillet, and he delicately placed a long, dark strip of kelp
      over them.    Montano was small. He was now in the large room of a palace,
      the kelp having now become a long rug running through the length of the chamber. There was a
      figure at the other end, and Montano squinted to try and make out who it could be. Of course!
      It was S. Churchyard!    “Hey! He’s wearing my blue blazer!” observed
      Montano. This was true, but Montano did not have time to act on this realization for
      Churchyard immediately began running towards him, rolling up the kelp rug with his legs as he
      came closer. Despite the playful smile on Churchyard’s face, Montano began to grow uneasy.
      With each step that Churchyard took, the kelp rug seemed to expand more and more until finally
      after a matter of seconds, all had been consumed into kelp darkness.</p>
