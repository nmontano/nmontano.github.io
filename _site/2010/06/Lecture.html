        <p>Identifiable by his tropical themed shirt, Harrig approached the front of
      the room to make an announcement. Montano observed that several people, mostly middle-aged
      women, were absent today from work.    “As some of you may know, today is
      the ‘Breaking of Bread’ in a certain religion, and as you can see, we are short a few people
      today as a result. Well, I’d like to tell you all about what this sick holiday means,” said
      Harrig with his slight lisp. Montano didn’t know much about the holiday, but assumed that it
      mostly had a social function. “The ‘Breaking of Bread’ is much, much more than just a simple
      meal meant to build fellowship. No, it is far worse than that. In a biblical sense, and I have
      done the research to prove this, the ‘Breaking of Bread’ has its roots in an ancient tradition
      where one would kill a member of the family. Just as one breaks off bread from a loaf, so does
      one kill off one of their kin. Frankly, it makes me sick that so many of our employees would
      participate in such a horrific holiday. Nevertheless, we must respect their religion, and that
      is why we have let them off for the day. I just thought you should know why they’re REALLY
      gone. Thank you.” Harrig walked back to his seat. Montano stared ahead for a few minutes
      pondering what had just happened, but then quickly forgot it and returned to work.</p>
