        <p>The orange city lights blurred by as Montano’s car raced over the slight
      incline, only to brake suddenly at the sight of several toppled semis in the middle of the
      interstate road. Surely the result of the snowstorm, traffic was backed up now for miles far
      into the city. Montano got out and observed a body being taken away on a stretcher, a man he
      thought he knew, whose arms had been folded over his chest. Montano squinted and noticed that
      the mouth of the body was still moving, saying something silently. A moment later when Montano
      turned back to look at the body, the man had gotten up and was chatting up the accident with
      some girl.    The outline of Castle Abongrijo could be seen in high in the
      distance. Beem, Krood and Montano made their way up the foothills, stopping to catch their
      breath after a particularly steep incline.    “So, there are two ways you
      can go now,” began Montano. “Through the wheat field, or down the lentil trail through the
      forest. I wouldn’t go that way though, because you won’t get there before nightfall, and thats
      when the horrors come out. I say we go through-“    “Yeah, we know, we
      know,” remarked Beem with an air of boredom. Montano did not appreciate this lack of interest.
      Didn’t they know that he had been to Castle Abongrijo many times? But Montano also knew that
      Beem was in love with Krood. Montano improvised:    “OK. You two take the
      lentil trail, and I’ll meet you on the other side of the bridge to the castle.” With that,
      Beem handed Montano their two large army overcoats and they began their trek down the viscous
      trail of cooked lentils.    Montano reached the painted wheat field and
      struggled greatly as he climbed through a colossal stack of bundled wheat. Upon reaching the
      other side, he dumped the army coats and began running towards the castle.    He pulled on the switch for the overhead lightbulb, revealing the peeling red paint of
      the walls of Castle Abongrijo. It was a dump, true, but he had to stay here. As he walked into
      his sleeping closet, he found a tape adapter and a note from his supervisor:    ‘Enjoy your stay! You may have company.’    -Alwin Ganes    He entered a larger room and found the remains of some uneaten coleslaw.
      Horror filled Montano. It was night, and he had never met Beem and Krood at the bridge! But
      worse, this coleslaw meant that there were other forces in the castle. And to confirm his
      fears, sinister, unearthly voices started to approach from one of the nearby
      passageways.      “And that is why people in horror stories go
      mad. It’s because of the mountains!” exclaimed Montano to his grandfather and Merrem,
      concluding his lengthy discourse. They did not seem convinced.    “Yeah,
      but at the end of   Dracula  , Jonathan
      Harker is all like ‘I want my teen wishes.’” countered Merrem. “He kills Lucy’s sister on the
      beach.”    “I don’t remember that part…” said Montano quietly.</p>
