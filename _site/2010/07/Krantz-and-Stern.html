        <p>Montano’s mom rolled down the car window.    “I’m not
      coming back until you do your ‘Forever Lazybones’ dance for somebody here.”  “Why do
      I have to do that?”  “Because you have to start making connections!”    And with that she was off, driving deeper into the library’s mountain range.
      Montano looked around. Ahead of him in the very dim room was the circulation desk. Was the
      library director near here? He decided to just wander around and look for somebody to dance
      for.    There was a light drizzle in the library. After some directionless
      exploring, Montano came to a stairwell that looked familiar, though he didn’t think it lead to
      the director’s office. Suddenly, a young Spanish girl ran into him, giving him a brief glance
      and then continuing on down the stairs. He could tell she was distraught and on the verge of
      tears. Montano followed her down.    As he entered the door into the
      spacious apartment, he realized that this was the domicile of his two friends, Krantz and
      Stern. The Spanish girl was talking rapidly to Krantz while Stern stood and watched from a
      distance.    “You must do something! They are coming any minute!” she
      exclaimed.  “Calm down, calm down. Who is coming?”  “Them!!”    A large patter of footsteps could be heard on the stairs. “They’re here!”
      cried the Spanish girl. Montano decided to move away from the doorway, walking over to where
      Stern was standing. They exchanged nods. Montano sensed that there was trouble afoot, but he
      had no way of leaving this place and would have to stick it out.    The
      door burst open and several young kids in helmets and other protective gear entered. Now it
      was clear who ‘they’ were: The Environmental Enforcement Squad!    “So,”
      said the leader as he headed over to Krantz. “Thought you wouldn’t see us again, hmm?” He
      laughed and then motioned to the other squad members to enter. “Let’s clean this place
      out.”    Despite the concerned faces of the Krantz, Stern and the Spanish
      girl, Montano didn’t seem terribly worried. That is, until he realized that at some point he
      had exchanged all of his clothes for a small bath towel that didn’t even cover his knees.
      Montano began frantically looking around for some clothes, only to be approached by a member
      of the squad who stopped and looked over him and his strange attire. There was a tense silence
      between them that was finally broken by the squad member:    “Yeah, that’s
      environmentally friendly.”    Montano sighed in relief.</p>
