        <p>The sun was shining a little too brightly in the park. SAM jogged over to
      Montano who was kneeling in some mud.    “Hey there, Montano,” he began, a
      fake smile on his face. “Just want to make sure you know that you’re coming up to bat real
      soon.”    “Yeah,” said Montano with a sigh. “I know.” He looked over to
      the stadium where the pitcher was throwing a bubble to the batter. When it finally was within
      hitting distance, the batter swung, popping it instantly.    “We just want
      to be sure that you’re all prepared for your turn at bat. You’re coming up real soon,”
      reiterated SAM.    “I know when I’m supposed to bat!”    “Great!” SAM flashed another fake smile. “See you soon!” He ran off.    Montano lifted himself up from the mud. It was obvious that this game meant a lot to SAM,
      and also that he had little confidence in Montano’s athletic and mental capabilities.
      Disillusioned with everything, Montano decided to go on a walk.    Night
      fell. Entering the retro lounge, Montano recognized a girl who he had known from somewhere,
      and approached her as the wall intercom began speaking:    “There is a
      snow emergency issued for tonight. Please do not call security if you suspect an alien
      invasion. Thank you.”    The girl turned to Montano. “Do you remember last
      year when everybody called in about an invasion during the blizzard?”    “Yes.”    SAM ran in to the lounge:    “Montano-glad I found you. Do you know you’re up to bat real soon? I wasn’t sure if you
      knew, so I thought I’d tell you that you should start warming up because you’ll have to hit
      the bubbles when you’re at bat-“    “I KNOW I HAVE TO HIT BUBBLES WHEN I’M
      AT BAT.”</p>
