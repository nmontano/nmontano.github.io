        <p>“And so, the hermetic wiseman, as well as the ward’s most valued object,
      Patient 67, took it upon himself to do the unthinkable,” Gerald Bloomberg took a pause for
      dramatic effect. “As he walked to the window and slowly opened the stale drapes, he looked out
      into the world for what was the first time in years. This was to be his last day there-his
      release was that same afternoon. If the sight of the world hadn’t been enough to reawaken his
      senses, surely the sight of a woman sitting far below in a nearby park, a beautiful woman,
      would fly him into ecstasy. And so it would. For this same woman was to be one that would
      become the prime mover in his life-the gorgeous and elusive Lisa. Now, the feelings he felt
      for her were only inklings, but they would grow into strong passions such as the world had
      never seen.”</p>
