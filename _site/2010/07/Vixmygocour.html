        <p>“Ohh, and wouldn’t he look sexy in   this   one?” asked one of the sultry girls as she placed yet another
      dress in Montano’s arms.    “I’d love to see him in   this!”   The other handed him a brown dress, a
      trendy one where cookies would cover the breasts he did not have.    “And
      look at these rippling pecs!” remarked one, pointing at his flat chest. “We should touch them
      to see how firm they are!” They nodded to each other in agreement.    A
      hand slowly approached Montano’s chest, and when just inches away from making contact with his
      pink polo shirt, he spoke:    “Don’t touch my muscles!” He dropped the
      dresses and ran deeper into the mansion.    Montano slammed the door to
      the bathroom shut. The marble walls and floors established this as a premier bathroom; one in
      which he would hide from the two girls. He couldn’t let them touch him, no matter how strong
      his desire.    Immediately, Hansona and Hoeksfeld entered the bathroom,
      and without acknowledging Montano, entered two stalls on opposite ends of the wall. Montano
      entered the middle stall, confident that nobody would find him in there.    It wasn’t long before the overpowering stench of human waste reached his nose, and he
      began to panic. He needed to get out, but then the girls would find him! Immediately, he heard
      the bathroom door open and the voice of one of the girls:    “Is he in
      here? Let’s check the stalls.”    As soon as he heard one of the stall
      doors click open, Montano burst out of his, past the girls, and out of the bathroom where he
      was able to lock it, trapping the vixens in the terrible stench.    Montano did not have time to relax though. There was a lurking terror he needed to
      confront.    The cardboard web loomed ominously over the frozen foods
      section of the grocery store. Jack, Montano and the others approached cautiously, for they
      knew what lay behind it. Unsure of how to begin, Jack pulled off one layer of the web,
      followed by Montano who took another. The rest of the group watched in silent fear, too
      cowardly to help.    When the web had been cleared, all that remained was
      a dark abyss that nobody was willing to enter. At that moment, The Man Spider quickly emerged
      and darted out into the store. The hunt was on! Jack and Montano ran after him while the
      others ran and hid. Finding The Man Spider was only half the battle; the danger was in not
      being destroyed by him upon his capture.    They darted through the
      aisles, following the brief glimpses of The Man Spider as he flew from wall to wall. “There!”
      pointed Montano. “No-there!” cried Jack, as he spotted the creature in a new location.    The chase went on, but there was no sign of catching The Man Spider any time
      soon. Montano and Jack were growing faint from the hunt, meaning that they were now prime
      targets for The Man Spider to devour due to their weak states. Knowing this, they decided to
      hide, but before they could a voice rang out:    “I’ve got him!”    They ran to the source of the voice to find that one of the store employees
      in the produce section had defeated The Man Spider with his shoe. Jack and Montano approached
      the corpse, for now, after death, his true identity would be revealed. They turned the body
      over to discover the lifeless face of Gunther.    Montano approached the
      cowards, who were seated on a couch and eating a frozen pizza.    “Well,
      I’m glad we got that taken care of,” stated Plarkin, cockily.    “What?!
      You didn’t help at all! You just ran away!” cried Montano.    “Nuh-uh!”    “Yeah-huh!”    Montano looked out
      the window at the rolling plains where he saw two small figures.    The
      Business Man looked out across the prairie at the approaching storm. The winds were picking up
      quickly, and rumbles of thunder could already be heard. His camel sensed the impending danger
      and backed up, attempting to leave.    The Business Man pulled the leash,
      jerking the camel back to his side. The storm was just upon them now, and The Business Man,
      knowing what he had to do, walked himself and the camel directly into the tempest.</p>
