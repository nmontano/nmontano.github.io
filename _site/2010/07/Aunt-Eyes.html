        <p>Nantho  : But if you had
      to get stabbed in your eyes, where would you want it to happen exactly? I mean, I know I would
      want it to be on the side [indicates space between eye and bridge of nose].    Montano  : I agree-that’s where I was
      thinking I would want to be stabbed in the eye. But do you think it would hurt less if it was
      just right in the middle, through the pupil?    Nantho  : Hmm, I don’t know. Why would you think that?    Montano  : Oh, just because, you know,
      it would go straight to the nerves and maybe knock out all the nerve endings really
      quickly.    Nantho  : Hmm…    Montano  : I mean it might not. But
      maybe you could have surgery and they could detach the eye nerves from the brain.    Nantho  : Oh, of course they
      could.    Montano  : That would be
      preferable to being stabbed.    Nantho  : Well, one thing for sure is that those ears aren’t going down
      without a fight!    Montano  : You
      mean eyes?    Nantho  :
      Yes.</p>
