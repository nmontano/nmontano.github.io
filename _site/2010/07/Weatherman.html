        <p>“You see, storms have a lot of majestic beauty that really just shows the
      awesome powers of nature,” stated Brunk as he sat down in his chair across from Montano in the
      apartment.    “Yeah,” replied Montano, who was usually quick to agree with
      him. Montano glanced out the window, which gave a view from such a high vantage point that it
      could only have been seen from an airplane, to observe a large tornado in the distance. “WHOA!
      Check out that tornado!” he exclaimed.    Brunk stared at him and then
      continued speaking once more, but Montano was entranced by the approaching storm.    “Hey, which way is west?” he asked while staring out the window at the storm,
      which was clearly heading towards them. Brunk continued speaking, ignoring his question. “Hmm,
      well if the wind is blowing that way, then I guess-“ at that point Montano was interrupted by
      the tornado hitting a nuclear reactor which created an enormous explosion that then began
      consuming the city he was now somehow flying high above despite being in an apartment
      building. His eyes widened and he turned to Brunk who was now absent. The metamorphosis was
      complete, and Montano found himself in a box floating high above an ensuing chain of
      explosions, each more devastating than the last. He watched in captivated awe as the storm
      consumed Brunk’s building as well as the rest of the city with only himself safe from its
      devastating reach.    When the worst seemed to be over, Montano steered
      the floating box down to the street level with his mind and walked out into the disaster area.
      There was a slight drizzle accompanying the end of the storm, but the sun was already shining.
      He began wandering around the destroyed homes and fallen trees, completely enthralled by the
      aftermath of what he had seen. Soon, he heard a small voice:    “Help!
      Help me!” It seemed to be coming from a car that hadn’t been damaged by the storm at all, and
      Montano ran over to investigate. On the floor of the backseat was a skinny milk maiden who for
      some reason could not get out.  “Here, crouch down,” ordered Montano. She obeyed and
      he reached in through the windshield and pulled out her frail body from the backseat. She
      hugged him and ran off.    Montano smiled to himself as he continued his
      stroll through the wreckage. He kept recalling to mind the huge winds and gigantic explosions
      he had just witnessed, and how completely awesome they had been as they annihilated the city.
      Yet one question plagued his mind: why wasn’t anyone else around to reminisce with
      him?</p>
