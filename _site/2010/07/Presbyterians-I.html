        <p>The harsh white walls of the expansive, yet sparely decorated room screamed
      down at all who wandered through it. More like a modern art exhibition than a visitor center
      for a corn field, the footsteps of everyone inside reverberated loudly in the emptiness.    Montano came to a magazine rack and began flipping through one, looking
      mostly at the pictures. He turned the page to find the eyes of an incredibly stern man in a
      pilgrim’s outfit staring back at him, the circular frames of his glasses intensifying his
      gaze.    “I know him!” exclaimed Montano. Indeed, he was a fellow
      presbyterian in Montano’s congregation. But why was he featured in this magazine? Montano’s
      eyes wandered over to the accompanying article. It appeared that The Stern Man had been hired
      as Head Torturer at The National Museum of Horrors.    Montano raised his
      eyebrows. This was an impressive promotion-it was difficult to land any sort of job at that
      popular attraction for children. But The Stern Man certainly fit the bill, and Montano knew he
      was going to be a great Head Torturer.</p>
