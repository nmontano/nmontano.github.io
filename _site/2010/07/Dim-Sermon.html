        <p>Montano spied a copy of one of S. Churchyard’s books under the arm of the
      officiating minister. Today was the marriage of his cousin Mercourt to Kopatch, and the
      sanctuary was filled to capacity. The marriage party entered and sat down in the pews,
      Mercourt in the one behind her husband. The lights were off, which didn’t bother Montano, but
      he knew he would hear about how “dark” and “gloomy” the sanctuary was from somebody
      later.    The minister began:    “I have been reading
      a lot of Churchyard’s books recently, and I think it is time that we really got to the bottom
      of what our religion means.” Montano gulped; he knew what was coming. “Is it about gaining
      popularity? Or just being nice to people? Is it about getting the best deals on car insurance?
      Is it about low, low prices?” The minister began parading around the pews. “Is it about
      synthesizing all religions into one? Do we even know what we are talking about when we mention
      God? We don’t!”    Montano noticed somebody further down in his pew had
      brought a copy of the ‘Tao Te Ching’, certainly so that she wouldn’t be identified as a
      christian. Simultaneously, the minister noticed this book, too:    “Sure,
      there were missionaries that tried to equate God with the Tao, and maybe they were right! But
      to bring such writings here, on this joyous occasion, is unspeakably sinful!”    At this, people started to shift uncomfortably. The minister was going too
      far. Fortunately, she had disappeared into one of the closets, and it was up to the associate
      minister to finish the sermon:    “Kopatch, it is our sincere desire that
      you run your household like our heavenly father. And Mercourt, that you act as his Holy
      Spirit, whose eastern equivalent would be the Tao Te Chang.”    Montano
      frowned. It was pronounced   ching,   not
        chang.</p>
