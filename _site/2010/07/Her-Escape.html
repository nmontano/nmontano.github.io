        <p>The One Who Left ran wildly about the backseat of the car. She had put up a
      good fight while trying to resist Montano, but she was simply no match for him and now found
      herself imprisoned. She desperately looked around for a means of escape, as it was imperative
      that she continue the allegorical game of life and death that she had been playing with The
      Old Dog and The Younger Dog.    Her paw inadvertently rested on a switch,
      rolling the windows down to her surprise. She immediately jumped out the car, and having
      briefly seen the outline of Montano in the distance as she landed, dashed off into the dark
      parking garage. She had escaped, but she would have to run fast; Montano was coming.</p>
