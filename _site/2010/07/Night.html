        <p>Save for the dim light coming from the car’s radio dials, everything was
      shrouded in the deepest darkness. On either side of Montano in the backseat were two large men
      who had been and would remain silent for the entirety of this journey. Montano felt slightly
      squished between these small giants, but he didn’t care too much as his mind was preoccupied
      with the driver’s discourse. For some time now the driver had been explaining something, but
      Montano had been interrupting him incessantly to ask questions:    “So
      when I got back from-“  “What do you do?”  “I got back from the
      Marines-“  “Did you like it?”  “I tried to get in touch-“  “How
      long were you in it?”  “With some people-“    Despite the fact
      he was in a car with strangers, Montano felt very happy here, like a child, which caused him
      to continue his questioning without regards to whether he was being annoying or not:    “My sister-“  “Was she in the Marines?”  “Will be meeting
      us-“  “What’s her name?”  “When we arrive-“  “Is she
      nice?”  “In a couple of hours-“    The small light from the
      radio dials illuminated Montano’s face slightly in this dark night. He looked out the window
      into the the inky void, sometimes believing he saw the outlines of buildings against the
      opaque canopy. The car drove on; another form against formlessness.</p>
