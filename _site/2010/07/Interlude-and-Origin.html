        <p>Pierre sped in his sports car along the top of The Great Wall of Logs. He
      was traveling fast, but he knew this stretch of road like the back of his hand. Set against
      the deep yellow sky, Pierre was the only one on the road, giving him license to assuage his
      need for speed. Like second nature, he made a swift turn to match the serpentine wood road’s
      curve while still managing to hold a conversation with his son over the phone:    “I’m just coming back from the conferences now. I could not believe that the
      teacher didn’t think I was from Milan! She said I was too chubby. But you’re tall and you’ll
      look like you’re from Milan and that’s good.”    Pierre raced on. The
      Great Wall of Logs was one Bretagne’s most famous and enduring attractions. Even since ancient
      times people had pilgrimaged to it to collect wood for their villages, if only to heat the
      churchhouse for just a few more sermons during the winter months. Though Pierre had traveled
      this road innumerable times, today it reminded him of something. But what was it? Ah,
      yes…    Deep in the sewer, three men stood clustered around a table. A
      long middle finger jutted out onto the map, slowly dragging along to pinpoint their exact
      location in the underground labyrinth. Dressed casually in a polo and khaki pants, Hook
      glanced at his henchmen with a devious smile.    “Look, boss,” said a
      cohort as he pointed at the map, “One, two, three, four, five entrance points-none of them
      with phones. It’s all been a set up!”    Hook gave a dismissive snort. Of
      course it was a set up. He had known that all along. The only question was: where was The
      Bat-Man?    Like clockwork, the metallic body of The Bat-Man emerged
      upside-down out of the ceiling. A smile came across Hook’s face.    “Eh,
      so you thought you’d join the party?” jeered Hook.  “You have two minutes to leave
      this place. I have set explosives.”  “Get him!”    In an instant
      The Bat-Man had disappeared deep into his elaborate network of sewer tunnels, leaving Hook and
      Co. scrambling to escape. But their fate was inevitable. The explosions began.    Yes, from now on, Hook had finally earned his namesake, for though he would
      make it out of the sewers alive, he would not remain intact. There was only one man who was
      responsible for his disfigurement, for his new monodigital chrome hand, and who would need to
      learn the full measure of his wrath: The Bat-Man.</p>
