        <p>Together the first letter of each fairy’s name spelled out E FLAT. They
      were huddled together now, awaiting instruction from Peter Pan.    “Ok,
      ok,” started Pan as he entered the room. “Estallot. You first.” The blue fairy quickly flew
      over to him. “So what you’re going to want to do first is take the band-aid,” he handed her a
      clear, used one, “and wrap it around your head, sticky side to your skin.”    The fairy complied and began wrapping it on her face, though the band-aid’s large size
      made the task difficult. Sensing she needed assistance, Pan approached her and began aiding in
      the process.    “Yeah,” he said. “You’ve got it. Just keep wrapping it…”
      His voice trailed off as he gazed at her seductively while moving in closer. Finally, he
      passionately embraced her, pressing their lips together through the tape.</p>
