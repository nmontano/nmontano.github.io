        <p>Like those before it, the monkey peered in impishly through the window from
      the tree branch. Unamused, Montano also approached the window and returned the primate’s
      stare. Suddenly, a giant smile grew across the monkey’s face and it erupted in laughter,
      leaning backwards into its tree branch as Montano stared at it with great annoyance.    This monkey, and those that preceded it, became pirates.    The pirates surrounded Montano in the wooden room, and he rightly sensed that he was very
      much the outsider. However, curious about their dreadlocks, he gathered the courage to
      confront one.    “So, what’s the deal-are you guys Jamaican?”    “What?” responded the short pirate. “JAMAICAN?!”    The
      room burst into laughter.    “Well,” recovered Montano, “I thought that
      your hair looked rather-“    “No, no. This is sub-Saharan!”    “Well, it can’t   all   be
      sub-Saharan.”    “You’re right. But you’ll have to figure out which parts
      are!”    “Fair enough. This,” began Montano as he stroked the long strands
      of the pirate’s beard, “is most definitely sub-Saharan. But this,” he pointed to the green and
      yellow dreadlocks, “is Jamaican.” And indeed it was.    Later, Montano
      challenged the same pirate to a contest concerning whether or not he could get a chair into
      the shaft of light in the middle of the room. The pirate succeeded, to the cheers and
      exultation of his comrades.    “Haha! Poor boy!” mocked the pirate. “And
      now you can buy a beer for me and all of my children!” The other pirates laughed, but Montano
      became uncomfortably aware of the connection between what the pirate had said and the claw
      shovel in the corner holding four moist fetuses.</p>
