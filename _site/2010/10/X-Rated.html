        <p>“Mulder, what is that ticking?”    “Scully…RUN!”    The FBI agents dashed out of the car only seconds
      before it exploded. From a safe distance they watched as sand slowly filled it, burying it
      deep within the blue tinted woods. Two cardboard cut outs of Mulder and Scully popped up in
      the car, their guns at the ready, and a tape recording of them firing at invisible enemies
      played.    “Look, Mulder, they’re closing in,” remarked Scully of the The
      Syndicate’s henchmen moving towards the car. “We can ambush them if-“    “No, Scully, we have to go now!”    “But Mulder!”    “SCULLY-NOW!”    Mulder grabbed her and they began crawling their way
      over the blue sand, deeper into the forest…    The Cancer Man addressed
      the group at the table, puffing periodically from his cigarette as he spoke.    “As you can see, we’ve selected some very fine specimens for you all.” A wave of his hand
      indicated the beautiful women lined up and facing them. There was also a very old, ugly one
      also smoking a cigarette.    Near a light filled door in the room, Montano
      had fallen in love with a stripper named B, and as they embraced, he became confident that she
      was not wearing any clothes under her bath robe.</p>
