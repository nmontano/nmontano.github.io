        <p>“Well, look this over and tell me what you think.” Gridin handed Montano
      the sheet of paper which he eagerly reviewed:    “…Tried to get a copy
      of ‘The Room’ to Joni…met up with famous gay rapper Fag Dawgitty…found dark chocolate
      Reese’s. No, they were called Ichigoos, but still in that orange wrapper…”    Montano turned to her. “I think it has got a lot going for it. You should put it in the
      blog. Now, I want to explain what happened-“    “I’m not going to put it
      in. There was a word I forgot when I gave her that movie.”    “Oh,”
      replied Montano, irritated. “Well, whatever you want. I think it is pretty good. Anyway, last
      night I went to dump my coffee in the sink where somebody had been making pudding, and the
      mixture made a terrible green goo thing. So, I left and when I got back, three more coffee
      cups had been dumped in the sink as well as several broken wooden spoons. I got kind of
      freaked out because, you know, that’s what happened to the Virgin Mary.”    Gridin and Montano were immediately shifted to the backseat of the car as The Man in
      Glasses turned around in the driver’s seat to address them as he violently backed the car
      out.    “You know,” he began. “Tomorrow’s lecture is all about how that
      experience with the Virgin Mary didn’t actually all happen at once, but over the course of
      several years.” The car sped off.    Later, Montano found himself in his
      wheelchair among the red walls of the kitchen that was the focus of story he had told to
      Gridin. As he rounded a corner, he met the frail figure of Grossemann.    “So, Fried,” his tone was uncomfortably calm, “I hear you don’t want me to mate.” Montano
      could not decipher if he was upset or not.    “Haha, yeah. Well, It’s
      because of your psychic powers. I just don’t know if that should get in the gene pool.”    Grossemann laughed. “You’re right. They could be used for ill as well as
      good.”    “We don’t want that!” said Montano. As he stared at his nemesis,
      he realized with increasing certainty that he had been the one to put the extra coffee and
      spoons in the sink after him.    “Just watch what I can do with my mind.”
      Grossemann grinned and suddenly Montano’s wheelchair began moving closer and closer to the top
      of the stairwell.    “Haha! Ok! Wow! Yep, you have a lot of power! Let’s
      stop now!” pleaded Montano. Grossemann was resolute, and just before the wheelchair was about
      to topple down the stairs, halted it.    “Should I still not mate?” His
      brain gave the wheelchair a final push onto the stairs.    “Grossemaaaaan!” screamed Montano as he tumbled. “GROSSEMAAAANNN!!”    Seconds later, the wheelchair very slowly collided into the wall at the bottom of the
      stairs, and Montano, unharmed, wondered if perhaps he had overreacted.</p>
