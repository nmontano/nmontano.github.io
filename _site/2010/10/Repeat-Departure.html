        <p>The pale orange sky of late afternoon signaled to Montano that he and
      Gridin had once again returned to Southfield. He sighed as he looked around at the wasteland
      of crumbling buildings and scattered trash. Now he would have to clean up his stuff again so
      they could leave, but would he again return to repeat the task? How many times had he
      already?    Montano walked into one of Miskatonic’s buildings to find
      several cats basking in a cool blue light. Gridin approached:    “Well,
      grab your cat and let’s keep moving.”    “Yeah, ok.” He looked down and
      found a Catboy sitting on a bean bag chair. When their eyes met, the creature nervously
      shuffled to regain its composure on the sack, its eyes darting around frantically for a
      possible exit.    “That’s the one,” pointed Montano.    It had been a greater struggle to leave Southfield this time, and the flippant black girl
      and nerdy Spanish boy had slowed them down considerably (eventually Montano decided to abandon
      them to their own devices in Southfield rather than take them along). But as they were leaving
      the city limits, Montano forced his sister to make one final stop…    Back on the road, he opened up the box of Little Caesars.    “Hey!
      This isn’t so bad!” exclaimed Gridin after taking a bite.    “I told you!
      There’s kind of a nice plastic quality about it. The synthetic cheese is strangely
      comforting.”    “Mmm. Give me another piece.”    He
      obeyed and they drove off into the night.</p>
