        <p>“Hey, I need to see a doctor right now,” said the teenage black boy.    “What?” began the black receptionist. “Shit. You boys are just all ink and no
      think.”    The boys laughed and joined the woman behind her desk.    “Excuse me,” started Montano. “I need to see Dr. Meseley Hatz.”    The receptionist and boys silently grinned at him and Montano grew very
      uncomfortable.   What am I doing wrong?   he
      thought.   STOP STARING AT ME!      After he had returned from his visit with the Anglo-Arab doctor, Montano sat
      down on his couch just as Heltroy entered.    “Hey! Want to play ‘Dog’ for
      a little bit? I’ve been wanting to play that with somebody for a while,” he asked.    “Yeah!” She excitedly ran over to him, and he knelt her down backwards onto
      his lap. Experienced in this game, he took his hand and began scratching her belly. “Heh heh!
      That feels good!” He continued the scratching until, inadvertently, their eyes met. His hand
      slowly stopped and they shared an incredibly uncomfortable moment as they realized they did
      not know where this game was going.</p>
