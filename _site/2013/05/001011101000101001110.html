        <p>Stone faced sat the Computerist. His technological skills-incredible, his
      religious views-unshakeable. Only the Master Computerist, who is ever behind him with a wicked
      grin upon his face, a cackle occasionally escaping his twisted face, has greater programming
      capabilities. He controls all that the Computerist does, though the Computerist does not know
      this.     Malsamo approaches the bar. The Computerist stares at him
      before:    “Do you believe that in hell the devil puts worms in your
      brain?”    “No.”    “Cut open my skull.”    The Master Computerist has drawn his influence from the lesser’s religious
      outlook. His skull, in fact, has already been cut open before as Malsamo now discovers,
      detaching the occipital bone. On the back of his pulsing brain is another smaller brain.
      Malsamo takes it in hand and it begins to snap and hiss at being removed from his meal (Master
      Computerist laughs). Malsamo takes a closer look and discovers two hooks on the back of the
      small brain. A hand helps two worms grasping upwards to attach themselves to it.    Computerist: “[librarian],[librarian],[librarian], will all learn and pay in
      hell.”    (cackling)</p>
